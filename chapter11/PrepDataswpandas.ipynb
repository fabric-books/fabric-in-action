The rooms are SMALL, unattractive, with terrible old bedding, virtually without windows or amenities. Parking was 38/day, and it took 35 min. to get your vehicle. Almost no lobby or sitting area, the restaurant was small, understaffed, with a severely limited menu.

When we made our reservation on the phone, we requested a crib for my son and were told it would be no problem. When we arrived we were shocked to see a pack-n-play rather than a crib and they didn't even provide us with a sheet. We called the front desk and demanded a crib. After a few hours, a crib was brought to our room... without even a crib sheet. After many phone calls to the front desk asking for a crib sheet we received a full size sheet for a crib. Apparently not a single person who worked there even knows what a crib sheet is. In addition to the crib and sheet fiasco, the carpeting in our suite was buckling and we almost tripped over it several times. There were also some sink holes in the bedroom. It seems that the hotel is about to undergo a much needed renovation, so hopefully they can also improve their customer service. The location of the hotel was the main reason we chose it, and it does have the potential to be a lovely boutique type hotel with some updates.Thank you for your candid feedback. I'm sorry to hear we didn't meet your needs initially with the crib. We've found that most prefer a soft-side crib over the steel framed ones. Once your requests were understood, though, our desk agents promptly retrieved a crib that was to your liking. We truly do appreciate your feedback and will use to provide better experiences.

AC was loud and inconsistent at keeping a steady temp. using an old mercury thermostat. continental breakfast was paltry compared to others hotels.Dear Josephcarter2018,Thank you for taking the time to review our property.

We chose it for its mid-way location between the WWII and the Ogden Art Museums, and the French Quarter. It is also only a block from the Charles St. trolley to the Garden District.Our 6th floor king-bed room was a little small by king standards, but didn't feel cramped. The only smallness inconvenience was a lack of night stand and light on one side of the bed (no room). The bed and pillows were excellent and the room clean. The bath room had ample space for both of our toiletry bags, and there was a nice tub/shower with great towels. The provided shampoo and other products were of high quality.Since our room was directly above Poydras Street, a busy thoroughfare, we expected some noise and on the first night, which coincided with a Saints NFL game, we got it. However the noise subsided about 10 PM after the game traffic cleared and each of the subsequent nights were pleasantly quiet. The A/C was efficient and quiet.This is a smaller hotel (compared with the mammoth nearby Sheraton) and the staff were always available and pleasant. There is a restaurant on the premises (we only had one breakfast there - very good) but many, many fine restaurants in all price ranges are within 5-10 min walking distance. I felt the hotel was a great value for the price and would gladly stay again.We're so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans!

We arrived late because we took the Amtrak from New York 36hrs we arrived at 21.30, very tired. Expecting a decent night sleep we were told they did not have a double room with a disabled friendly shower but a single room on the 7th Floor(they had elevators) with the correct shower. They asked was this acceptable We were so tired we said yes Ok. We were then informed that we would be charges an additional 50 per night for 12 nights for 'extras'. Extras we asked what extras/ Food, movies, drinks, breakfast.We were so tired we said OK. They then hit my card for 3000 - before leaving London we had agreed with our card company that no transaction would exceed 2800 as we had had stolen/lost cards in the past. We had forgotten this limit and the receptionist said the card was rejected. We could not work out why this had happened. So we paid for 1 night with the intention to sort the problem in the morning. However when we went up to the room we were delighted with the bathroom and felt that the size of the room was just about adequate. I was still upset about the card being rejected so I called the 'local' number of my bank. They confirmed there were no problems but reminded me of the limit I had set. As the room did not have a fridge or safe and as we were so tired I decided to deal with the problems in the morning. The following day I went to reception and the manager (i presume) allowed me to pay the bill account on 2 cards saying he understood why this had happened. I asked anbot a fridge he said it would be delivered. There was no safe available. I was not asked to pay the 'extra' this time so payment was made of a further 2200 split on the 2 cards. We went out and on our return found a fridge of 3ft square in the bedroom - so large that it hampered access to the bathroom. We had eaten out so thought we would watch a movie. The TV in our room refused to show us what was available so I rang reception - only no the line was still connected to my European Bamk on the local number. This phone call connection lasted 3 days.and paid 17.98 3minute . So, in spite of my disability I went down to reception and was told that they did not offer movies! As i had paid I could not afford to move and so we were stuck in this hotel. Finally on our last day no one helped with the luggage. I would write a lot but no more room We're glad you found the room size adequate and were delighted with the bathroom. I'm sorry to hear your bank gave you so much trouble with your credit card but happy to hear the desk manager was able to work around it. The reason you didn't have movies is because the 50.00 per night hold for incidentals (like movies, room charges, etc.) was waived due to the issues you were having with your bank and the monetary limits you had set. Also, (and again, in an effort to make you more comfortable) a fridge was placed in your room. I'm sorry to hear you thought it was too large but it's the smallest one we had. Additionally, your phone charges were waived when you didn't disconnect the International call. I am truly sorry to hear you did not enjoy your experience at the Whitney Hotel but it sounds like the staff went above and beyond to serve you and you were satisfied with the room so thank you again for mentioning that.

(plus I was there the day the St. Patrick's day parade occurred, and its route took it right by the corner of the hotel). I didn't use the restaurant but it looked very decent. It's quite close to the various things to do or a quick cab ride away if you don't want to walk.

It was convenient to everywhere in the city I wanted to go, though its location on Poydras street did mean the mornings were a little noisier than I expected due to the traffic, but you can't fault them for that. I had occasional difficulty with my room key working but still always got into my room. I didn't realize at booking that the hotel doesn't have a bar/restaurant and the room didn't have a refrigerator but that was my fault for not checking. Overall the staff was incredibly helpful, friendly, and made my stay. The hotel is very unique and original due to its history and not like every out-of-the-box hotel you find these days. It was nice to stay in a place with such character. Res877, Thank you very much for taking the time to share your comments about your stay with us at The Whitney Hotel.

Managers and loss prevention kept harassing us. Sunday morning knocked on my door and walked in without my consent and literally said oh i though you were smoking in here and walked out. I was hearing noise all night which i complained about, but nobody did anything about it: yet you're worried about if im smoking when your hotel is Loud and your staff is racist and rude because all of my greetings did not seem genuine. your loss prevention is not an army and i should sue for grievance. I complained about loud banging all morning and nobody did anything or come to see if it was still happening. Instead I got your army of LP at my door accusing me of smoking once again. without even saying sorry for bothering you. I WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN AND I AM A MARRIOT REWARDS MEMBER. There were stains on my bed which i let go. my towels were not clean so i requested new ones.

The room amenities are very nice with very comfortable bedding and living area. The Kitchen area is small, however, with a small mini refrigerator and microwave so if you are planning to eat many meals in your room, this is not the hotel for that. We walked to Little Italy, the Gas Lamp area, PETCO Park and to the USS Midway. Very convenient to all locations. They have Valet parking and a restaurant on property although we did not use it. They also have a fitness area and a indoor pool.Steve, thank you for a perfect review! We are so happy to hear you and your family enjoyed your stay with us here in San Diego.

Sleek and modern decor with marble countertops stood out to me. There were two flat screen TV's, and a fully-stocked mini kitchen with fridge. Located right in the middle of downtown minutes away from the gas lamp district this place is prime location. The luxurious amenities combined with meticulous customer service especially in the downstairs restaurant makes for a memorable experience that I wouldn't hesitate to highly reccommend over and over again!

Do Not stay in room 1501. Although the room seems like it is a bit away from the elevators the bed room is right next to the elevator shaft. This would be fine if it was just elevator noise but every time it went up and down the banged like the someone was knocking on the door loudly. All night all day whenever someone was in the elevator. I complained the first night to the front desk and actually a maintenance guy, Jared. He said that Otis elevator was actually on site fixing the elevators. They actually came to room but could not figure out where the noise was coming from. I did mention it again on Wednesday but they did not do anything. They could have at least moved me to another room. On Friday I was supposed to meet someone for dinner. I did not have his cell though. I had stepped out of the room for a bit, unfortunately right when he called at 630. He tried again at 7. The staff did not leave a message on my room phone (or my cell/email which they had). At 9 I received a call from the front desk that I received 2 calls at 630 and 7. When I asked why I am just hearing about it at 9, the woman said the note got lost and they had just found it. Oh did I say the pool was closed. Lastly, 1501 is a joined room and on Friday night, at 11 a family decided to have a fight where someone was slapped and the mother and little daughter started crying. I called the office but as far as I know no one came up or called. Just not a good stay. Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback and leave a review.

Unfortunately, I had pulled my hamstring prior to my arrival and was in extreme pain after walking through 2 airports and pulling my luggage. The hotel staff took me to my room in a wheelchair and brought me ice and other items to assist with my pain. On top of that, they gave me a Get Well card signed by all the staff. The room is nice (not too big and not too small) and the furniture is well appointed. The bathroom is a really great size with the closets located inside the restroom along the wall (nice touch). Before I arrived I read the reviews where other travelers complained about a reflection on the sliding door that separates the living room from the bedroom at night. I did not experience that. I enjoyed the indoor pool/jacuzzi and the close proximity to the Donut Bar (the donuts are splendid), the House of Blues, as well as other restaurants, banks and stores. The street it is located on is more quaint than lively, but you're a stone's throw away from the action. The room service is great ( I ordered breakfast a couple of mornings) as well and the delivery team makes sure you're satisfied. They also have a discount card avail (not sure it's available to all traveler profiles) that you can use at nearby restaurants which was a plus. I really enjoyed this property which I will definitely book when I return to the San Diego area.Thank you for a perfect review!

And because it has most of anything you need at pretty high quality, it is not cheap. We stayed for two days and enjoyed both beertasting and whiskey/whiskytasting for only 5 each. The bartenders, John and Ben, did a fine job! Breakfast is not included, but it's not very expensive and you have lots of choices. We didn't try the restaurant. They served us good hashbrowns and perfect eggs which were impressively fast on our table. Good selection of teas and real freshly squeezed orangejuice. Staff looks happy, not just polite. Great room, loved the chocolate! Fine beds, fridge and microwave in the livingroom and tv both there and in the bedroom. Modern fascilities for charging phones etc. Even if you need an extra plug, it's already there. Any niggles Well, parking in cities may be difficult, but 42 per night with valet and 35 without seems to me a bit over the top, the room comes at a price so it ought to be half the price for guests. After all, just a few blocks up you could park for free on the street.

Anthony, security management, was at the door with a note of well wishes for me plus a box of gourmet cookies. We were just blown away how fabulous his concern was for us as their guests.

The food was ok but for some reason lacking a bit in salt to our latino taste buds. But the coffee great. Restaurant open at all times which is practical.One thing that should be handled is the dirty windows from the outside.

Never have I seen vehicles parked at this concentration at the front of any hotel before! Upon entering the Hotel, I see a very new hotel look and like what I see. I wait but a few minutes and then am assigned a room. Room 127, first floor. I checked in at about 9:30 PM Saturday night and that was what was available, but requested an upper floor room, if available, the following night. Duly noted.First room impression. Beautiful room so far. How do the lights work Not the usual toggle switch. No hint from the front desk about simple light operations, at all. Onward into the dark room until I get the lights on. No master switch. Every light has its own switch. Bathroom has three. Awesome bathroom with glass doors.First night room impression. HVAC works well. Not too loud. People walking down, and talking loudly, the hallway can be heard clearly ! People running or walking upstairs sound loudly. Slamming doors on every room are very loud inside my room. Screaming or running children are not silent! The sound of dripping water from from an upper level HVAC unit sound like tapping on my window tap most of the night long. Second night impression. Moved upstairs to Room 226. No more frequent travelers headed for upper levels. Same drip drip drip sound from an upper level HVAC unit dripping on my window frame, or HVAC frame. Only on screaming child in the hall about 7:30AM.The desk personnel were very simple and personal. They helped me move a room request. Parking impression. Ugly. Animal like. You gotta be kidding me.

I needed early checkin which I arranged months ago. Didn't get it. When we were able to check in noticed wet section if carpet. Thought maybe they cleaned something up. Next morning 1/4 room saturated. Went to front desk. They said probably Ac problem. They said no problem to fix. We left. 6 hours later returned problem not fixed and water is traveling. Went to front desk. They said something like this can't be fixed in a day. What did you expect Odd, I expected it fixed. Can you at least suck up the water No, we can't. Hmmmmm. You will get a new room. I said no, fix it. Our time is limited and on way out soon. They said they'd send someone to look at it. Twenty minutes in the bar (nice bar and staff) went up to room. Maintenance had it fixed in 5 minutes. They placed towels on floor where they stayed until we left. Thank you for your feedback. I apologize that we were unable to fix your air conditioning issue immediately. Through our several interactions with you early in the day, you were offered a room move several times until we could get the resources to fix the leak in your air conditioning. I am sorry that the staff that you spoke with were not more empathetic, but they did offer you alternate accommodations.

Staff were very friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet and early evening 'Happy Hours' were unexpected surprises. Casual dining at the bar or at the tables near the pool was ideal. The free wifi was appreciated but I was a little disappointed that the courtesy shuttle to and from the airport has been discontinued. The hotel is only a 15 min walk from the delights of the San Diego Old Town. The Transit Centre offers a choice of bus or Trolley downtown, or a no 30 bus for the 30 minute ride to La Jolla. A day pass covering both buses and trolleys is great value. With the distances between attractions in San Diego cab rides can be expensive.Good day Ronald S,We are so happy to hear you felt welcome in our home and we would like to thank you so very much for sharing your experience.

The hotel was clean and free breakfast was great. The hotel seemed to be newer as evident by the modern decor.For those traveling with small children, our room only had a shower. Our 2 yr. old has only taken baths so he had to quickly get used to a shower, which did not end up being too bad for us. Location is excellent as you are 10 minutes from Sea World, Zoo, Balboa Park, USS Midway and much more. Parking is usually 16 a night but when we checked in they gave it to us for 10 a night! We rented a Hyundai Elantra and anything bigger would have been a pain to park as spaces seem very tight.

Very large property, very modern and clean with a huge common area off the lobby. I think this Hampton may have the most awesome breakfast buffet in terms of size I have ever seen, and I have stayed at a LOT of Hamptons. Triple waffle iron area with 4 times the variety of toppings... say wahIn all seriousness, the rooms were very nice, clean and comfortable. The entire property was. The front desk staff was super friendly and welcoming. It felt like an upscale Hampton here.Now, they lost one star for two reasons - parking, they charge. To me it is insane to charge a customer for parking unless you are MAYBE downtown where I get parking is a commodity. This is Hotel Circle for crying out loud and they charge 18 bucks a day which is ridiculous. I have status with Hilton so they did lower my parking to 10 per day but it was still annoying and felt like they were simply trying to generate more revenue... particularly due to there was PLENTY of parking. The other reason was the housekeeping. We were there four nights and I had to call for housekeeping to come clean up my room. My husband had spilled a little something on the sheets and I was very surprised that they did not flip out the bottom sheet. Nope, left the stain there which was kind of gross.

The large was extremely comfortable, but there were a few issues I experienced: - The hallways smelled of dirty wet dog. - There were outlets for charging on only one side of the King bed. - I expected liquid soap in the bathroom and shower as I've had at the last two Hamptons I've stayed at. - There is a hotel being demolished on one side of the hotel, so the construction noises started fairly early. - The breakfast buffet was extremely sub-par. The paper plates and plastic utensils were just tacky and I expected more from a Hampton. The food options were lacking, the fruit was not fresh, the eggs had an odd flavor, there were no breakfast meats at all, and the self-serve coffee was empty and when I politely alerted a staff member, I was basically ignored.Dear Will L,Thank you very much for taking the time to review your stay with us.

Right off freeway. All places we wanted to go were within 5 miles. Comfy bed. I thought pillows too flat (soft), but still slept well. While we were there it was pretty quiet. Our room faced a hotel that is being dismantled. My husband was awakened once by noise that was from there, but it was only for a few minutes. I wasn't disturbed by it. I would suggest asking for a room that did not face that way, especially if you are a light sleeper. The hotel and our room quite clean. From the reviews I read, I think the hotel is less than 2 years old. They have free wifi. Parking is 16 a day/night. There was plenty of parking. We stayed 8/23-8/26 (Sun-Thurs). During busier weekends or holidays not sure of parking situation or how quiet it would be. The breakfast is fantastic and staff kept all items stocked to 10am when the doors were closed. Many choices. Examples: Scrabbles eggs, sausage links, sausage patties, ham, gravy, biscuits, omelets, home style brkfst potatoes/hash brown dish, oatmeal, hard boiled eggs, variety of fruit, muffins, bagels and breads (toast it yourself), make your own waffles, 4-5 different dry cereals, variety of yogurt cups, variety of coffee, tea, oj, apple juice, milk. Variety of jellies, cream cheese, creamers, sweeteners, peanut butter, honey, syrup, butter, margarine, etc. Every day we were there all the hot items were different. The hot egg, meat, potato dishes listed above were not all one day. There were four different items daily of the eggs, meat, and potato dishes. I figured at least 10-15 per person savings if we had to buy breakfast somewhere. All hotel staff very friendly and helpful. I highly recommend the Old Town Trolley Tour. Check out all details on line. According to information, the trolley picks up at the hotel. We did not get that early of a start to be picked up at the hotel. Not sure when or where return would be for the trolley. For the times and things we did, it worked out better for us to park at Midway and get on trolley at that location.Dear Pam O,Thank you for your 5-star review. We were thrilled to read that you enjoyed our central location and the great attractions that surround us. Additionally, we graciously appreciate you recognizing our friendly and helpful team. As for your description of your breakfast experience, the only word that comes to mind is wow. Thank you for painting such an amazing picture, our breakfast team was ecstatic. I cannot begin to describe the smiles you brought to their faces when they read your review thank you very much for making their day that much better!Last, but certainly not least, thank you for leaving a traveler tip.

For the money, you can't beat Hampton Inn Mission Valley. The staff is very friendly and helpful, the complimentary breakfast is the best I've had (and I stay at many hotels), and the rooms are clean and modern. The temperature is easy to control, and there were extra blankets in the closet. We got daily housekeeping service and they did a great job. There is a pool and hot tub, as well as a fire pit. The pool is smaller than it appears in the picture, but it was never overly crowded and my sons had a blast playing in it every night. The town is a short Uber ride away.

None of their King rooms have baths, only showers. I could not properly wash my hair with a tiny showerhead. Many King rooms have communicating doors to the next room, which are good noise-carriers. With regard to noise: the rooms at the freeway end of the hotel are very noisy, much more so than other hotels we've stayed in on Hotel Circle South. We were living out of our suitcases because of the ridiculous size of the drawers in the room (basically the size of nightstand drawers - see picture). The pool is the size of a large hot-tub. Breakfast had many items but lacked quality: the only good things we found were yoghurt and fresh fruit, cooked food was poor.Hotel staff were helpful and did their best to resolve our issues in a not-so-great hotel.

Two big detriments: 14 to park, which is ridiculous for a Hampton Inn. Really!! And the bathroom doors have automatic closers, which is terribly annoying, especially when you have little children with you. When I commented to the front desk clerk on checkout what a hassle this was, she said, Yeah. I know. It's a problem we're trying to work on, but with 182 rooms, it takes a lot to do all of them. I said, Well, you should at least provide a doorstop in the room. Her reply was, Oh, you could have asked for one. We have them here. Well, why on earth isn't there a notice to that effect in the room We could have avoided a lot of misery. Anyway, the staff was very nice. The breakfast was very good. We didn't have an opportunity to use the outdoor/pool area, but it looked very inviting with a nice lounge/conversation area. We'd probably stay here again, but we'd definitely ask for a doorstop if they haven't fixed the doors yet. (And we might try to strike a deal with the restaurant next door to park for less.)Dear Traveler, Thank you for reviewing our hotel. The comments are insightful and helpful for the hotel teams goals to improve the service and guest experience. Please accept our teams sincere apology for the failures in service that resulted in any inconvenience and lack of comfort. We are grateful for the choice you made to be a guest of the hotel.

This location has a Starbucks's that served breakfast. Breakfast was not free unless you have a voucher from the front desk. Christian was very nice and gave us vouchers for one morning of our stay. The pool is heated and felt great. The hot tub was also a welcome relief to sore muscles from all the walking we did on Old Town. One of the great features of this hotel is that it is walking distance to Old Town and restaurants. It is also centrally located to the freeway and MCRD and not far from the airport. It does have a shuttle on Thursday and Friday to MCRD. and LIMITED airport shuttle service.

All I had to do was present Voucher upon check in Spoke to the Operations Director the next day. She couldn't do it either. And stated you got a good rate anyway I would have gotten a lower rate if they honored it and would have proven that the Corporate programs works. Oh well...Next issue parking fee of 20/night. Other Marriot Hotels waive the fee if you are a Calif. AAA member. Brought it up and was told: we don't do that here Ok, I can accept that. However, parking on property is underground and VERY LIMITED. If you drive in and no spaces, you need to back up all the way out. Had to park on the street both nights (which would have been FREE). Other than that, the room was clean and spacious enough. Closet space was small but adequate for the length of stay. I like the pull out desk/table. The shower soap was smallL. Could not get a good grasp on it. It was not larger than 2 flash drives end-to-end and just a little bit wider. That's it. I kept dropping it.

The wall of mirrors in the rooms is awkward when you are sharing a room with your mother, although I think it would have been weird if it had been my husband and I too. The bottles of water in the room for 2.50 a bottle seemed a bit much since the next best western offered a complimentary bottle of water for their guests. With the price I paid for the room, for them to charge for water we thought it was ridiculous. Plus I stayed at a lot of hotels on this trip and this was the first one to charge a 75 dollar hold for the room in case we caused damages. We drove to san diego from Portland Or, because we couldnt afford to fly we had a credit card with just enough money on it for the room, which we had to get because my brother was graduating from Boot camp, and we had to scramble to find a card to put the money on which took out of our gas money. The king sized bed was actually a queen and the queen beds were double beds. There was hair in my bed the first night and part of a sticky note the second night. The shuttle driver the first night was kind of a jerk he made everyone get on the first shuttle so he didnt have to make a second trip so people were standing and crouching in the aisle and then he told everyone if they can drive they should so they dont have to be on the shuttle. Maui was a great driver but we did not like this other guy. I also had to get my key reactivated 3 times because it stopped working. I will be letting the Marine admins that recommend this hotel to visiting families about this stay."},{"0":"Southampton","1":"32.75985","2":"-117.16502","3":"Best Western Seven Seas","4":"2","5":"We arrived at this hotel a little early for check in so we went to get some essentials from the supermarket. We arrived back at the hotel for the 4 pm check in to be told it would be another 30 minutes before they had a room for us. When you state that's it's a 4 pm check in you have the rooms ready for 4 pm not 4.15 or 4.30. This shows me how much they regard their customers/guests.The room was clean and tidy but we had booked a deluxe room and we were not happy to see an adjoining door to the next room as we have experienced these before when we hear everything from the next room and I expect they hear everything from our room. If they want to cut energy costs then move the table away from the front of the a/c unit and let it work properly and don't mess about turning fridges off as they will run for longer to get cold again. Found the noise to be rather overbearing at times with guests stomping along the walkways and slamming doors at all hours if the night. Housekeeping seems to be scarce on the ground at this hotel at times. If we are in San Diego again I doubt we will pick this hotel again. It seems that Best Western has a special training course for front desk staff in how to be rude and unhelpful and to treat the guest as an problem rather than the reason for them having a job as this is the second Best Western we have encountered this poor service from front desk staff. All in I would not and could not recommend this hotel to anyone."},{"0":"Zurich","1":"32.75985","2":"-117.16502","3":"Best Western Seven Seas","4":"4","5":"We stayed overnight in San Diego on our roadtrip.

We had a quite room on the ground floor."},{"0":"Townville","1":"32.75985","2":"-117.16502","3":"Best Western Seven Seas","4":"4","5":"I took my almost 13 year old niece to San Diego. We stayed 5 nights at this hotel for a total bill of 307 which is really cheap for San Diego. That price got us a room with 2 queen beds right by the pool (room 103). Room was small as others said but not as small as I thought it would be. There was one night stand between the beds but we could walk around the other sides. The room also had a desk with chair, a dresser, and an upholstered chair. I thought the beds could be more comfortable. There is a plug issue with two outlets where refrig, blow dryer and coffee maker plug in. It wasn't too much of an issue because we just unplugged the refrig when we briefly needed the other appliances. Mirrors didn't bother us and they do make the room feel larger. Room was very clean, bedding was clean and of fairly good guality. Probably the biggest negative was thin walls and doors that you could not close quietly. So we heard noise above us and we were bolted awake one morning by a neighbor 's slamming door at 6:30am. Plenty of free parking. beautiful grounds, sparkling clean pool, nice jacuzzi and great location. Hotel shuttle driver was very nice and reception crew was always helpful. I also appreciated the free computer in the lobby to print our boarding passes. I would stay at this hotel on another trip to San Diego."},{"0":"San Diego","1":"32.75985","2":"-117.16502","3":"Best Western Seven Seas","4":"4","5":"Due to LOSSAN performing track maintenance, I wound up spending a few days in San Diego.

It did, however get the job done and I was well rested and got some work done.

Hotels near to the city centre are much more expensive and it only cost 9 dollars in an uber to the harbour plus the bus terminus is only ten minutes walk with frequent travel to the centre. Our stay was comfortable and the staff helpful and polite, no problems with the room It was clean and roomy and you also have free on site parking which is a bonus. A couple of small swimming pools if you would like a relaxing dip and well kept gardens throughout the location. On site restaurant and bar which we didn't use as we were out early and back late.

I'd say mostly positives for us! The property was obviously being attended to while we there, with gardeners replanting and pruning the day we were leaving, the exterior building was being washed down. Very nice plantings all about. Cafe, very satisfactory. Free parking very welcome. Our convention was only a 5 or so minute walk away. We were anticipating free breakfast with the reservation (was discussed when reservation was placed) but because we didn't have documentation of that, we weren't able to counter the front desk assertion that we did not have breakfast with the reservation. So be prepared with your paperwork. Just about once a day, 1 or more of us had our room key cards not work, so we had to go to the front desk to have them reset somewhat tiresome especially because we were housed in the furthest bank of rooms from the office. For the room, yes per other reviews, the a/c is set up such that it's an uneven situation, especially at night when sleeping. We dealt with it. Some sort of problem with shower pipes in the room above, when at 3 and 4 in the morning (!), a loud rattling pipes noise commenced, for a good 10 minutes. We alerted the front desk to the problem in the morning. The noise did not occur the next evening, but it could have been because then there was no one in the room upstairs afterwards during the span of our stay. Sure parking was very tight on the Saturday evening, but it was Saturday night, late we did eventually find a spot.Frig worked well. Plenty of towels. Room didn't at all seem overly dated. Beds were satisfactory. We indulged in the pool one late afternoon, but it ended up being the same time as what appeared to be a family reunion so shifted after a little bit to one of the hot tubs. Very nice nonetheless to have a pool and 2 hot tub options on the property. There is also a small gym facility adjacent to the pool.We would stay here again!Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. We welcome all guest comments especally when they are so well thought out. The Best Western Seven Seas is an older property however, we are continually upgrading our guestrooms, exterior, and other amenities in order to meet the needs of our guests. It is great knowing you enjoyed our convenient location and that it met your conference needs. We look forward to seeing you on your next visit whether for business or pleasure!

While the room was clean enough, the entire facility is in need of a complete renovation.We were very disappointed as we had a week reservation.My first clue that this was going to be sub-Best Western standards was the fact that their airport shuttle was unavailable for when we were arriving.I will say the hot tub was certainly hot enough and other than the foam that was created when the jets were on(add some more soda ash), was very nice.I am glad we really only slept here as we were about town for most of our stay.Dear Brian: Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your candid feedback.

It is close to downtown San Diego and Ocean Beach which is important to me. We eat over in Ocean Beach but see theatre shows in San Diego. They did not have any 2 Queen bed rooms available upon check in this past visit but upgraded us for free to a King size bed which worked out perfectly. The rooms are dark (can make them dark for sleeping), clean and no bed bugs as I check before bringing in my luggage. I always wish we could stay more than one night as it's my number one choice of a place to stay in the San Diego area. Some hotels charge you for parking which I just dislike. I did my research before staying here the first time and it paid off. We had a horrible experience up in Vista and did not want a repeat of another crappy hotel. Next trip down to San Diego for another theatre show we will be staying here again. Can't recommend this place enough!

The bathroom needed work, It wasn't the cleanest. Old door and moldy corners. The grounds of the motel are very nice. However, keep in mind that many temporary workers and hotel help obviously live in the motel. Ask for an upstairs room, the lower rooms are loud. And stay away from rooms across from the laundry.

I didn't use the fitness room as looked a bit 'testosterone laden' with too many men working out for me, but the pool was clean and warm.It's in a strange situation on 'the Hotel Circle' which literally is a circular route of hotels with an elevated highway running alongside them, about 3-4 miles from downtown, so there is a bit of traffic noise, but Downtown hotels are ALL on the flight path of either the Navy airstrip or the international airport!

The cute theme and color coordinated dcor inside and outside of the buildings put me into relaxation mode. The diner on site is convenient. I slept comfortably in the bed. It was over all a quite restful environment."},{"0":"Barstow","1":"32.75985","2":"-117.16502","3":"Best Western Seven Seas","4":"3","5":"First of all I want to say this was a good trip but not because of the MOTEL. We went to sea world, koby's swap meet and did a lot of shopping. The Hotel has around 200 rooms, one pool, two hot tubs and a small restaurant on site. Some of the rooms come with microwaves, fridges and other necessities. Sadly when I arrived at 3 they didn't have any rooms available for check in. We had to wait for half in hour but I didnt mind because we went out to eat and came back. We walk into our room which was right next to the pool and once we walk in the room had an old big fashion TV with a small fridge and no microwave. I asked about the microwave but all of those rooms were booked even though I booked my room 3 days in advance. The small thing I didn't mind but I did mind when the bath room door would not shut closed and the bed was rock hard. Also the internet they provide is WIRELESS B which is one of the slowest connections possible. I couldn't stream any thing on my laptop and at midnight my wife woke me up because she was hearing a LADY SCREAMING TO DEATH!! I call room service and they said they will send some one to check it out but another twenty minutes passed and the screams came again. Then after another phone call to the front desk we finally got some one to check it out and it was the couple next door fighting and throwing stuff at each other. The worst part was the front desk calls me two hours later to tell me they checked out the problem. This was at TWO in the MORNING!!! I would not recommend this hotel to any one. If you can spear the TEN BUCKS do it. I learned the hard way and went cheap and suffered the worst sleep that day. The only good thing was my daughter loved the warm pool that doesnt close until 10pm.Dear Guest,We are happy to hear that you had a good trip to San Diego, but we are sorry that the Best Western Seven Seas did not meet your expectations. Our rooms are often booked months in advance, especially for the summer, and unfortunately we cannot always provide last minute bookings with a specific room type. We are in the process now of updating and upgrading our bedding package which includes mattresses. As for the late night disturbance, we apologize that you were not happy with the way the situation was handled. Guest disturbances should be handled in a very sensitive manner, and we have discussed the management of the issue during your stay with our team leaders and their staff. We are always looking for ways to improve and take your comments seriously. It is the mission of our company to see that each of our guests receives an excellent service experience and we are sorry that your stay did not turn out that way. We thank you for staying with us, and for your valuable input to how we can run our business better. Kind Regards and Safe Travels,Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff"},{"0":"Land O Lakes","1":"32.75985","2":"-117.16502","3":"Best Western Seven Seas","4":"4","5":"While looking for affordable accommodations in this area, I kept finding places that charged extra for parking, which is something that just rubs me the wrong way. Best Western Seven Seas has plenty of convenient parking, and I was able to park either right in front of our door, or at worst, a couple of spaces down. The room was average size and clean, the a/c worked and the shower had good pressure. Nothing fancy but all that we needed, and a good value for the area. It was very convenient to the freeway and we were able to get in and out easily. I took morning walks in the area and I did notice that most of the other hotels on Hotel Circle S also had free parking, but none had such a large and nice complex. I didn't utilize the pool or the hot tub, but I did see that many guests were, and both areas looked well maintained. A young man did come in while I was checking in asking if they had a basketball to go with the basketball hoop. They didn't, so if you think you or your kids want to shoot some hoops, bring your own ball. It is not a court, but just a simple hoop at the end of the parking lot.I will stay there again if in the area.Thank you for being our guest at the Best Western Seven Seas and taking the time to review our property, we really appreciate your feedback.

This is NOT a 3 star hotel. This is an older hotel with wear and tear that makes this more of a 2 star hotel. The last time this place was renovated was (I'm guessing) more than 10 years ago. Tell me, how clean do you expect 10 year old carpet to be The lack of an in-room microwave and no poolside towels are two notable deficiencies. Most Best Western's provide some sort of a breakfast but this place does not. Having said that, the location in Mission Valley is very convenient and when you factor in free parking and discount pricing (from Hotwire / Priceline)... this place is actually a decent value.

We would like to apologize for the service you received at the front desk, as our company believes that each of our guests should experience exceptional service when they stay at one of our hotels. The front desk may not have had a situation that played out as yours did before, but we have spoken with the department on how to handle these things better. We are an older property, and like all houses and buildings, there is occasionally the visit from bugs. We undertake a comprehensive pest control program which includes regular visits from a specialist pest control organization for preventative maintenance. It is important to advise our guests that silverfish are indeed not related to bed bugs. We take bed bugs very seriously, as they are an infestation that can travel and affect guest comfort, however we take all bug visitors seriously since your feedback we have notified housekeeping and our pest control department to monitor the area. Regarding your further comment about reheating your food, unfortunately the San Diego County Health Department will not allow food into our kitchen that does not come from a permitted Food Distributor.

It is almost as if they are responding by a written list, like a customer support rep from India would. They repeat the same answer over and over rather than trying to listen to you and work on something. I stayed for a week, and during the week I complained that what was supposed to be a queen bed was not. IT was clearly not a queen bed. I am not stupid, I sleep in a queen at home. But the staff was insistent. The manager offered me 25 off per night, which I accepted. But here comes the major issue. On the 13th at departure my card was charged, and the charge approved by the bank for the total bill with the discount. In the next two days a second charge for the exact same amount, but as a different transaction. The accountant Ms. Loupe like all the staff there insisted this is normal, it's just a hold of funds. What funds You already got the money, it's gone from my account to yours. If I had not had the funds in my bank to cover this unwarranted second charge. I would be severely over drawn, and subject to many many fees. This is extremely unprofessional and unacceptable. No hotel should do this, no hotel does this. But they did. Supposedly the charge will drop, but even if it does I am still very unhappy. You can ruin peoples credit by doing this to them. I will talk briefly about everything else. The hotel is older, but well maintained. Parking is plentiful by narrow. During the day behind the office building where the laundry is, the day staff leave a wooden gate open, which extends slightly past the fence. It is extremely tight and difficult to squeeze between it and any parked cars. Additionally there was no handicap parking convenient to the handicap room. The bed was alright, but clearly not the size advertised, as I stated prior. The housekeeper who usually did our rooms was extremely nice, she offered my partner extra coffee for the room, and even asked if we wanted the beds made. As we prefer to use our own blankets. The hotel itself was nice, but there were just so many big errors. I will never stay at this hotel again."},{"0":"los angeles","1":"32.75985","2":"-117.16502","3":"Best Western Seven Seas","4":"5","5":"Staff was great. Close by so many attractions.

All good, rightNo...upon check-in, they add a 75 block to your credit card, and say it'll stay from 5-7 business days. That's outrageous, and when I asked why, was told people steal TV's from the rooms. If so, 75 doesn't cover a replacement (and they should rent to better people!). Short-sighted for them I was going to book another night a few days later, but learned they'd block an additional 75...this is building customer loyaltyOn check-out, a guest was complaining that she had no hot water for 3 days...the front desk clerk's attitude was 'management cut back on maintainance. Lovely. Worse, the morning shuttle I'd booked and they reconfirmed the night before was cancelled as the van driver decided to help a family load suitcases into the van......at which point to desk clerk called me a taxi and had the hotel pay for it - a VERY generous gesture!Like I said, a difficult review to write.

The room was clean and smoke free as promised. The AC also worked very well.

I know it's moist in San Diego, but doesn't necessarily mean the room should smell moldy.

Checking in experience was very bad, desk clerk was poorly trained. I was assigned to room 159. It was a non-smk room, but has a big ashtray installed right on the wall outside the room door. The room smells so bad, they sprayed so much air fresher trying to cover the smell from odor smoking but made it worse. I found so many hairs on the bed sheet, there's a big area of yellow stains on the sheet as well, I wonder if they change the sheets after each check out or not. I went to the desk checked out, they charged me for the night anyways, without any apologize. I left my phone number for the manager to call me back, one week past, they never call me back. I gave them more than enough chance to solve the problem, but I guess they rather prefer me to share my experience with the public.So, if you don't care about the cleanness, don't care about the service, don't care get you and your family sick, don't care about they will ruin your vacation, go ahead book your room at this hotel!!Dear Sally C.,Thank you for your review, we appreciate your valuable feedback.

(Check several sites on the Internet for the best rates under 100 a night. Compare to the Best Western site.)The hotel is more of a motel with exterior hallways and no elevators. The room was small, but clean and adequate. The bed was comfortable, but the mini fridge was quite small. I requested a quiet room since the hotel is next to the freeway. It had a smal pool and two hot tubs. The fitness center was a room next to the pool with only a half dozen treadmills, elipticals, and a few free weights. If you want a serious workout, ask about local gyms or jog along the bay. The grounds were nicely landscaped and the place was very clean.The hotel is minutes from the mall, Old Town, and the aforementioned freeway will start you on the way to Balboa Park. The freeway near Balboa is narrow and congested at times, particularly when the zoo closes and the downtown workforce heads home. Plan on traffic issues.There are many places to eat in the area--ask at the desk. Old Town is nearby, but there are also cheaper fast food places."},{"0":"Columbus","1":"32.75985","2":"-117.16502","3":"Best Western Seven Seas","4":"3","5":"I stayed here for one night in a single queen room. The room was very small and dated. The worst part of this property is how thin the walls are. You can hear every conversation that your neighbors are having as well as anytime the toilet is flushed, shower is on, door is open/closed etc. If you are only looking for a cheap place to stay this may suit your needs but there are many better options in hotel circle (even for the same price)."},{"0":"Portland","1":"32.75985","2":"-117.16502","3":"Best Western Seven Seas","4":"4","5":"We moved to this hotel from two doors down and were extremely pleased. The rooms have been renovated in the past 2 months and were clean and fresh, albeit small. I recommend buildings 1,2, or 3. The grounds were lovely and calming and the pool was clean. Downsides: No continental breakfast, slow internet connection, a microwave didn't come with our room and the shuttle times weren't great for young children. Also, the TV channels were extremely limited, and there's no DVD player, but you can pay for Disney shows or Curious George at 4 each episode. We walked over to Bunz for food which was better than the restaurant. Great location, close to everything, but you need a car."},{"0":"Whittier","1":"32.75985","2":"-117.16502","3":"Best Western Seven Seas","4":"3","5":"The grounds are dimly lit at night and it is hard to find your room at night. The room numbers are too small to read and not reflective so impossible to see. Parts of the parking lot are narrow and hard to drive your car or back out of your spot without the possibility of hitting a structure or landscaping or planter. The room was smaller than I expected since it had two beds. One bed was up against the window pressed right up on the a/c unit. The curtains were so long they hung over the a/c unit. When I turned it on the air flow blew directly behind the curtain trapping the air flow. I had to MacGyver some decorative pillows to keep the curtains flat to let the air flow into the room. There is only 1 plug by the sink. You can not have a hair appliance plugged in and the refrigerator at the same time. Your choice of cold food and drinks or groomed hair. The room was clean. I do not like the way they charge my room to my debit card. They charge your room rate with the incidentals charge at check in and then charge your room rate again at check out. I checked in on a Friday night. The extra charges came off when I checked my account again on Tuesday. An inconvenience if you are on a tight budget and using a debit card. Overall the grounds were well kept and the room was clean, but had poor appliance, electrical outlet and furniture placement. No elevator for 2nd floor rooms."},{"0":"Las Vegas","1":"32.75985","2":"-117.16502","3":"Best Western Seven Seas","4":"4","5":"We have now stayed here three times and really like this place.

(Avoid Hwy 5 if you're coming in from up north. Tons of roadwork). Anyway, the staff was friendly and quick to serve us. It was 2am so there wasn't a line. But it was great to have keys in hand within less than 7 minutes. My issue with this place have to do with:1) no parking 2) how my husband and I had to walk from one end of the parking lot to the other end to get to our room. (I'm pregnant btw, to give you more context). It seemed like there were way too many cars for the number of rooms.3) The bed sufficed though it was hard. We both passed out so it didn't matter too much. 4) The AC worked. But it sounded like the people upstairs were running the shower all morning. 5) There is no tub. It's a stand in shower like in gyms. Not that that mattered to me. But water got all over the floor and you may want to bring sandals to stand in. I have a Best Western rewards card.

I was wary of it based on some negative reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. Check in was easy, and they let us add a day to the end of our stay at a discounted rate. The room was clean and included a mini fridge and coffee maker. We had the queen suite, which includes a bedroom and a separate living area with a pull out sofa. It included two full bathrooms, both with showers. I showered at different times each morning and always had plenty of hot water. I was apprehensive about using the pullout sofa so I brought a blowup twin mattress, and there was plenty of space for it. The only kind of gross thing was that there were a couple of hairs in the obviously otherwise clean pillowcases - I attributed these to belonging to the housekeeping staff. We asked for more linens and got them within 20 minutes.The room entrances are all outside off the parking lot, but I never felt unsafe as others have mentioned. The door had two secure locks which I used, but I never saw anyone hanging around during my stay that made me feel nervous about security. I did not hear excessive noise, but then again I sleep with ear plugs, so who knows. Nothing noticeable while I was awake. The washers and dryers were nice to have - you will need quarters and there is no change machine. The pool looked nice although I did not use it. The on-site diner-type restaurant was a little pricey, but the food was good. Room service is available until 10PM.All in all it was a pleasant stay. I would not stay there again for Comic-Con, as I realized it would be more convenient to stay downtown, but in general it's a fine motel in a good location."},{"0":"Weyburn","1":"32.75985","2":"-117.16502","3":"Best Western Seven Seas","4":"5","5":"This hotel is not on or close to the strip but perfect if you are in Las Vegas to golf or sight see.

We couldn't even get a late check out. Check out was at 12. And we were only able to get until 12:30, and even then, they made it seem like a complete hassle. The internet was terrible. It would go in and out the entire time. As we were checking out, we wanted to microwave some food and were told the guest microwave was broken. We asked if there was another microwave we could use and were told the only one the guests could use was broken. Also, I've stayed in my fair share of hotels, and when I've booked through the hotel directly, as I did for this trip, I never had to pay the full amount upon check-in. I would pay a deposit and then be charged this full amount upon check-out. But here, I had to pay for the room, plus a deposit when I checked in. I thought that was weird. When we got into the room, it was hot and muggy. The A/C hadn't been turned on before our arrival (something I thought was common practice). Thankfully, we had our own fan to use while we waited for the A/C to kick in. Also, the fridge had been unplugged, so we had to wait to use that as well. I don't know if they don't clean very well or what, but the entire time I was in the hotel room, my allergies acted up. I've traveled to San Diego many times and stayed in various hotels and never before were my allergies affected until this time. Also, the last night of the trip, the fire alarm started chriping with a low battery every 30 secs starting around 5am or so. The best thing about the hotel was its location, but I couldn't see myself coming here again. It was in Hotel Circle, so I could throw a rock and hit another hotel I could stay in.Dear Lytrell M.,Thank you for taking the time to review our property and for being our guest. We are glad that you appreciated our convenient location. Based on your reservation details, we see that you booked an Internet Only special rate. For that reason, a full deposit restriction is mandated with this special discounted rate. Also, to prevent fraudulent transactions, and to cover any incidentals incurred during the guests stay, a valid credit card is required to be presented upon check-in. We do apologize for any confusion and for not being able to extend your late check-out request any further than 12:30 pm. Late check-outs are a courtesy for our guests and are based on our occupancy. We apologize for failing to meet your expectations and would be happy to host your next visit to San Diego and provide you with an excellent stay given the chance.

The staff was very friendly and efficient. I was traveling with a group of just over 20 people and upon our arrival they had all our rooms ready for check in. But, not only that, they also had all our keys labeled with our names and room numbers already on them. That made for such a smooth registration and check in (as well as check out). Our stay was for 4 days and 3 nights. Another convenience the hotel provided was a shuttle ride to and from the SD Zoo. Eliminating the chore of fighting through traffic, driving (in an unfamiliar area), and parking. The rooms were well maintained, clean and had small refrigerators in each room. The hotel also has a pool (which we didn't have time to use) and a restaurant serving home cooked meals on site. I also liked that it was quiet.Dear MariaLC60: Thank you for your nice remarks in regard to your recent stay. It is certainly appreciated! We are so glad that you enjoyed our friendly and efficient Staff, as well as our complimentary shuttle service that offers transportation to many local area attractions. It is a delight knowing you also appreciated our well maintained guestrooms, quiet property, and the convenience of a pool. Perhaps, you will have the chance to utilize it on your next visit.

I walked down the street instead and ate at the Burger Bunz restaurants..great food.Dear Guest,Thank you for being a guest at the Best Western Seven Seas and for taking the opportunity to share your feedback.

I was extremely grossed out and could not use the bathroom.The TV box was also missing so we could not use the TV.I contacted the front desk girl and she was able to switch us to a different (and bigger) room that had been renovated, and was clean so that was a huge relief. She was able to do this even though it was close to midnight.The TV box was stolen from the new room as well (these must be popular in the USA...lol), but the great maintenance man was able to get one from another room and install it the next day for us.The hotel itself was very close to lots of activities, so the location is good, but if you want a nicer room, go with 2 queens or a king."},{"0":"Port Hope","1":"32.75985","2":"-117.16502","3":"Best Western Seven Seas","4":"3","5":"This hotel Does Not provide shuttle service it is advertised on Trip Advisor as provided but is inaccurate please update as it cost money to take a taxi shuttle or ride share.

The room smelled strongly of cleaner enough to make my eyes water. The two control knobs on the A/C unit were broken and amateur repaired so that they did not work. The soap in the bath, down to a sliver, was not replaced. The coffee supplies were not replenished and the waste basket not emptied. They allow people to wander around the facility slipping flyers for other restaurants under the doors not a warm feeling for security awareness. The Cafe served an excellent breakfast good food and excellent friendly staff. I'd suggest you do not pay the up-charge to get breakfast 'included' in the room cost. You can get a good breakfast at the Cafe for much less than the higher room rate, and, if you want to go somewhere else, there are dozens of other restaurants in walking distance. Next time, I'll try a different hotel chain and walk over to the BW Cafe for breakfast."},{"0":"Torrance","1":"32.76299","2":"-117.15919","3":"Quality Suites San Diego SeaWorld Area","4":"1","5":"I basically live out of hotels and this is the WORST I have ever seen. Staring with parking you are paying 12.00 for a spot that you have to do a 3 point turn to get into and my Camry almost didnt fit into. The room was super small for being a family suite and everything was cramped. The was enough space between the foot of the bed and the tv table was wide enough for a vacuum to fit though as well as the space between the bed and the wall. The second room was divided by a French door only the fixed side of the French door had window covering so there is no privacy between rooms and the lights from either room shines into each other. The AC was weak and smelt like mold. The second room never got air and by the time you go to the bathroom forget it just open the window to let the air in. There is no circulation, except what was provided by a large fan in the wall between rooms that was extremely loud and reminded me of an attic fan. One good thing the bed was comfortable for a single night stay. This location does offer breakfast, but after making a waffle and getting a plate together and sitting down to eat each of us took a bite and ended up at Dennys down the street. I wasnt expecting a Hilton or the Ritz Carlton, but I was expecting something a little higher than what ended up looking like highway motel. Lucky for us we were there only one night before heading home to Los Angeles.Dear Guest,Thank you very much for your honest and detailed feedback on your recent stay at our hotel. Your feedback is extremely valuable to us, as we strive to improve with each and every stay. I greatly appreciate your comments about aspects of the room that need updating.

My first issue is the parking and there's not enough spaces. We had a suite that had a closed off living room but the AC unit was in that room and so even with the door open the rest of the room was hot. There was fan on wall but it was so loud you couldn't talk. The room was very small, so much that only one person could fit between the tv and bed. The shower was horrible. The temp never stayed the same. The doors into the building and the elevators were barely functioning. The pool was dirty and the surrounding area. Breakfast was okay. The staff was not very friendly or accommodating. We have never been to CA and so we had a lot of questions and the staff acted like it was such a burden to answer them.

Based on our past experience, we booked again for a family reunion and referred our family to also book this hotel. We arrived late at night and check in was fine. The lobby still looked nice and the elevator was still slow like we remembered. The first thing we noticed when we got to our room and turned the bed down were the yellow stains on the sheets. At this point I wasn't sure if the sheets had been laundered and they were permanent stains, or if the sheets had not been changed. I called the front desk and they had me come get a new set of sheets. By the time I got back up to the room, my husband had discovered the towels hanging in the bathroom had fresh lipstick/makeup all over them. I went back to talk to the front desk and the employee decided it was time to try a different room. Room 2 had a ant on top of the pillows on the bed and when we turned down the bed and pulled the pillows away from the headboard out ran 10 more. Back to the front desk we went and were now headed off to room 3. When opening the door to Room 3 we were immediately hit with what I can only describe as B.O. and it was potent. I called the front desk and told them about the smell and told them we would tough it out for the night as it was getting super late and we had a baby with us. I asked when the manager would be in the next day and was told 10 a.m. I ran the air vent on the airconditioner and also turned on the bathroom exhaust fan all night. The next morning the smell was as bad as ever. It literally was oozing out of everything in the room-the mattress, the couch. There were ants in this room also, but they were crawling on the wall instead of instead of in the bed. I headed down to visit with the manager of the hotel and found he was out due to an emergency. I expressed my concerns to the staff that was there (the housekeeping supervisor and a young gentleman) and asked to cancel the rest of my stay as well as the reservations for my family that would be arriving in town later in the week. The housekeeping supervisor came up to the room and acknowledged the smell and thought that it was possibly wet carpet-my opinion was that the room smelled due to body odor and not cleaning the room thoroughly. The only rooms the hotel had left were double rooms and she offered to let me walk through one before moving all of my belongings again, but I declined as we had already switched rooms 3 times and I also was very concerned about how many times my family coming into town would have to switch rooms to find an acceptable one.This hotel has drastically gone down hill in cleanliness since we stayed here last year. The linens in all of the rooms were stained and the towels were threadbare and grey. There were ants in 2 of the 3 rooms we checked into that night. I felt this hotel was along the lines of a motel 6 at best. Free breakfast cannot make up for a filthy hotel that is not being cleaned properly. We actually witnessed a maid RUNNING into and out of a room in less than 5 minutes. How do you clean a room that fast And we certainly didn't see a vacuum. We were wondering if the maids were paid by the room and not the hour. I do want to say the front desk staff was very accommodating and tried their hardest to find an acceptable room and I appreciate that they were willing to cancel our reservations when they realized their hotel had too many issues. ****PLEASE HIRE A SUPERVISOR FOR YOUR MAIDS AND INVEST IN REPL.ACING OLD/STAINED LINENS AND TOWELS***Thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey regarding your recent stay at the Comfort Suites Mission Valley SeaWorld Area in San Diego.

Very pleased with stay."},{"0":"Huntington Beach","1":"32.76299","2":"-117.15919","3":"Quality Suites San Diego SeaWorld Area","4":"3","5":"Ok people, before the bashing begins just remember you are paying roughly 129/night and you get free WiFi and a hot breakfast to boot. All in an area where it usually runs 200+/night. You get what you want to pay for it. You will not get Hilton like amenities at this kind of deal.First the good:1) Great location, right off the freeway, 2 min from a huge shopping mall and plaza with everything under the sun to eat at. 10 min from Seaworld or Gaslamp or Qualcomm.2) Good breakfast, decent choices, some healthy items, coffee is good.3) Fridge and microwave in the rooms. AC works nicely. The bed was good, with a lot of pillows, which I believe they just switched out to new ones.4) Friendly staff at front desk. Now the not so good, or you get what you pay for:1) The pool is loud when active until 10pm. The rooms face the pool in an L shape, it echoes through the halls. If no one is there, then it is fine. During summer, it's brutal.2) The rooms do need updating. You can see it is a work in progress, but the walls in my rooms were all marked up, the decor was outdated. Hallways and elevator showed heavy signs of use. Pocket door for bathroom was very heavy and loud. One telephone didn't work, etc. Our blackout drapes were torn and pulling away from the window, so it did not stop much light during the day for my son's naps.3) Thin walls. We heard every footstep above us, every creak. We also heard everything in the halls, and with the outdoor floors you can hear everything rolling on it, or people walking through. Once asleep, not a bother.4) 8 parking fee. Whatever, it is stated on the website. Just add it to the room rate and call it free, makes the customer feel better and not nickel and dimed.5) Ant attack in our room, but they did remedy quickly when we notified. 6) The sofa bed was a joke. 7) Elevator would take us to level 3 when we pressed level 2. All day, until I told them about it.Look, this place is ok. You get good value for the rate you pay, which is cheap. It is obvious the manager is doing a lot of damage control here on TripAdvisor by trying to respond to all complaints, which reflects why the ranking for this hotel is so low, as there are a lot of complaints.Would I stay here again with family Probably not. But for a cheap room, and if I was by myself maybe. But not for my family, there were too many annoyances, but we walked out of there for under 300 total for two nights. Good luck people. But don't nail the resort for not being like Hilton when you are only paying 129/night ok!It was my pleasure to read your objective review that pointed out the things you liked about our hotel, as well as some of the things you had a concern with. We read and act upon all our reviews in order to improve the service and comfort of all of our guests. It is clear you understand we are a very conveniently located hotel that offers reasonable rates, unique room layouts and features, a free breakfast buffet and most of all, dedicated professional staff. I agree there are some aspects of our hotel that are a bit overdue for attention, however we do have an on-going and aggressive improvement and upgrade schedule. This year the focus has been on new linen, early next year will be the furniture upgrades and dcor, among other items. As much as we would like to, we cant get everything new all at once, however we do have excellent engineers who keep things running smoothly, or if a guest discovers something we missed. Some things like a busy swimming pool in summer vacation season or parking fees for most all hotels in this area are things we cannot change. Even so as you pointed out, we think we offer the best in rates, location and value to our guests.

We requested twice and the second time was two days before we left so when the kids took baths that night we just made do since we weren't going to wait for maintenance during the bedtime hours.All in ill we had and enjoyable trip and this was a tremendous centralized location for all the sites we wanted to see."},{"0":"Sherman","1":"32.76299","2":"-117.15919","3":"Quality Suites San Diego SeaWorld Area","4":"3","5":"Very unique room configuration especially if you are a family.

Parking can be tough if the hotel is full especially if you drive a big car or truck. Exterior is in need of maintenance. Breakfast was plentiful and the normal Comfort Suites breakfast. Wifi was good. One thing that really disappointed me was the lack of many channels available on the TV. Had network channels, a couple of independent channels, did have Fox News but didn't work the last day I was there. No other news channels.Dear Guest,Thank you very much for your honest and detailed feedback on your recent stay at our hotel.

The hotel itself is fine (we had a room with a bedroom separated by a sliding door for the children, complete with bunk beds), has a good outdoor pool and spa, and a decent free hot breakfast. All in all nothing sensational, but clean, tidy, reasonable value and - assuming you don't miss the turn off from Mission Valley Fwy! - in a convenient location, only 5-10 minutes from Seaworld and maybe half an hour from Legoland.I am very pleased you enjoyed your stay with us and you were able to enjoy our pool and spa, as well as SeaWorld and LEGOLAND. Sorry you had hard time finding our hotel our frequent guests like to remember that we are on the same exit as the Mission Valley Mall. Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us, too often, guests do not take the time to share their positive comments but the good service you experienced is what my staff and I strive to provide to each and every guest.

Overall this is a very good property to stay at. The beds were very comfortable, the rooms stayed cool when using the air conditioner. We stayed a total of six nights here, five at the beginning of our trip, then checked out and went up to Disney for five days, then back for one night before flying out the next day. We were happy with the kids suite with the bunk beds. The bunk beds were a little squeaky going up and down, and while the child settled down trying to go to sleep, but nothing that kept anyone awake. The top floor was great for that length of stay, didn't have to worry about ceiling noise that way. The first night I didn't leave the fan on the air conditioner and heard the highway noise come through in the morning and thought a window was open. Turns out the door isn't completely sealed and noise comes through so leave the fan on (it kept the room nicer to sleep anyway). If you are a really light sleeper and can't have the fan on, you might not enjoy this place. The breakfast was really, really good. One of the best setups I have seen. Don't doddle getting down there as they are good at keeping everything nicely filled till about 9:10. Since the breakfast ends at 9:30 on weekdays, the doors are closed at 9:30. If you go down there at 9:25, get everything you need before going to sit down because you won't have a chance to refill because it CLOSES AT 9:30 PEOPLE. At least 4 days we were sitting on the patio waiting for out slowpoke eater to finish and people are getting mad at the girls trying to close the doors and clean up the breakfast because THEY weren't finished eating. Get up and get down there in time and don't bh at the girls doing their job.The kids really enjoyed the pool, we only had time to use it twice but they had a good time. I would have liked to use the hot tub but it was not working while we were there. It was a good week for us, the pool wasn't too busy and was quiet by 10:00.

Hotel Staff was nice upon greeting. Asked me to upgrade to a King with 2 bunk beds, but I kept the 2 double beds.The label of suite means an extra sitting room in the front with a sofa, small desk, TV, refrigerator, and microwave. The extra room made it nice for our little boy to play while we are resting in the bedroom.AC design is peculiar. Front room gets the main AC, then the room with beds is blocked by a glass sliding door. There is a fan which pulls the AC through to the bedroom. Bathroom was clean, but had a chemical smell. Carpet, wallpaper, and paint all look like they need remodel, which on the hotel website said was going to happen soon. Sliding door to bathroom does not have a lock. Nice to have 2 flat screen TVs. Bed was comfortable.We had a room in the back of the hotel, which made it quiet. The bathroom window faces a bunch of apartments, so you need to remember to close it for your privacy.Price was economical. I read the fine print about the 12 parking fee, I don't think is a big deal. However, they should create a line item in their billing before they quote the nightly price.Breakfast room was convenient and food was well stocked. I would consider going back to this hotel after the renovation. I hope they redo the AC system instead of relying on an old-fashioned fan to re-distribute the air.Dear Guest,We would like to thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey.

Basically, it's a long narrow room with a divider between the window and the bed. The actual bedroom is very small and the sitting area is even smaller. The A/C is in the sitting area and you must keep the door open to allow cool air to flow into the bedroom. The additional daily parking fee exasperated the problem. The hotel sits next to the interstate but the noise did not seem to bother us once we were inside the room. The breakfast which was included was more than adequate.Dear RobertPC118,First of all I want to thank you for taking the time to let me know your experience. I can assure you that we will use this information to look at the room configuration since we are currently reviewing plans to upgrade the property by renovating to improve our conditions.

The place has very, very old and beat up furniture and was either too hot or too cold -- the heating systems are terrible, built under the window as in older cheap properties and then the beds are behind some sliding doors, so you have to leave those doors open if you want any cooling. The breakfast in the morning is really disgusting. They seem to have people making the breakfast who know nothing about what coffee is supposed to look like, for example, or what bacon strips look like. They had a whole container full of picnic bacon, which is just scraps of pork in no particular shape, generally used as bacon pieces for other foods. And here it is in their hot breakfast like you are supposed to dive in and just eat those bacon scraps as if they are slices of morning bacon. Not me!The coffee maker in the room saved the day for us, because it was actually much better than expected. In a general sense, this room was not the quality that we expected for what we paid, and we were generally disappointed. Complicating the situation, we asked for a wake up call at 10:06 PM one night, and they promised to call. We were never awakened and it caused some big problems. I hope the attached photos help people understand why they should avoid this property.Dear Lindaj99,Very sorry to hear you were so disappointed with us during your recent stay.our main goal is to make sure all our guest have an enjoyable stay.Sorry we fell short of your expectations. the hotel will be having a full renovation towards the end of March.We hope you will give us a chance to serve you again.Thank you again for your comments.Best Regards,Laura BensonOperations ManagerComfort Suites MV"},{"0":"Fort Collins","1":"32.76299","2":"-117.15919","3":"Quality Suites San Diego SeaWorld Area","4":"4","5":"If you need a pristine trendy hotel, with all the amenities, this is not the place for you. But if you are looking for clean, comfortable lodging, and can put up with a few items that are rough around the edges, this may be the place for you. At about 70/night this place was about half to a third of some of the more modern places that are literally next door. Our modest sized room was a true suite with a door between the bedroom and the sitting area. The bed was extremely comfortable and there was a big, clean bathroom. Staff were efficient and friendly. The breakfast was all we could ask for, and was generally kept well stocked. The breakfast rooms are large with lots of seating. As noted, there were some rough edges: the ventilation fans in our room were quite noisy the screen on our window was broken and the pool elevator was creaky, with a well outdated inspection report posted. The location in the valley is just off of I-8, with lots of restaurants and shopping nearby. We were able to get most anywhere we wanted to go to see the sights in 10-15 minutes.Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your comments regarding your recent stay with us.

The rooms are decent but nothing more. The pool is small but I guess adaquate for kids. The walls are paper thin and we were awake every night by people walking in the room above. If you want quiet choose a room on the 3rd floor and away from the pool. The complimentary breakfast is just ok also. I love my breakfast and this was not that good at all. Eggs and sausages were not edible. At least there was cereal and milk. The location is good as there are several big shopping malls around. The zoo and sea world are close also.

The total amount of space seemed similar to an Embassy Suite with parents sleeping in one room and two kids in a bunk bed in a second room that you need walk through to get to the bathroom. It is true that the AC was kind of moldy smelling and the room did feel a bit run down and the guests, in general, didn't seem real classy. The immediate location isn't exactly romantic either, but it is well located for driving places in San Diego. The breakfast, by the way, was surprisingly good. If you are used to decent hotels, it will be hard to feel comfortable at this one, and I don't think you would choose this place for a honeymoon. Still, for around 100, I don't think you could find a better value for a quick overnight stay in a suite for a family of four."},{"0":"Gold Coast","1":"32.76299","2":"-117.15919","3":"Quality Suites San Diego SeaWorld Area","4":"5","5":"This place was a breath of fresh air.

Although the rooms are a bit dated it had a great comfy bed and a separate lounge. The daily breakfast was fabulous. It even had a hot dish to offer each day.

We stayed in a king size room with a pull out sofa bed. The king bed was very comfy but the pull out sofa wasnt comfy for the kids and wouldnt be able to accommodate an adult. You would be better to get another bedding configuration. The pull out sofa bed was in an offset room/sitting area (with a separate tv) that can be closed with a glass sliding door. The full room is compact so if you have very big bags, they wouldnt be able to be left open all the time as you probably couldnt walk past them. The kids loved the pool, and we could here a little bit of noise from where we were but not much (we were on the 3rd floor in the far corner so it was the quietest area). The breakfast and breakfast area was good. The staff were friendly and the location was central to the zoo and the airport. We used Lyft to go places. You could go across the highway to the mission valley shopping area but we didnt do that. There is a Dennys, petrol station, benihana, Wendys and another food place within several minutes walk (and a Wendys further) on the hotel side of the highway.

Lots of restaurants on University avenue just a mile from the hotel. Parking was convenient and free.We booked the suites since we were 5 of us. The beds were comfortable ( though I found them a little soft ). Still had a good nights rest. The bedrooms and the living room had a partition. Chairs table and a work station were in the living room. Our room overlooked the jacuzzi.The faucet in the bathroom definitely need work. It was tricky to figure out warm and cold since they worked in oopposite directions. Once we got it it was easy. I found the bathroom tiles like those found in a garden. had to use my slippers as they really hurt once out from the bath tub. We asked for the sheets not be changed. Liked their way of saving the environment. Requested for the towels to be changed.I wish the management had extra soaps since there were 5 people staying in the suite. We didnt have the time to go and request this.. We always carry some incase of instances where there aren't any. Breakfast was rrealy really good.. sausages, 2 types of eggs, cold and hot breakfast. There were tables and chairs inside as well as outside. Lots of place to sit. When depparting i needed some hot water. Couldnt find any in the coffee area, so the front desk requested the breakfast room door to be opened to assist my request. Thought this was really nice.

The parking lot was very small and hard to get a spot. When we finally got in the lobby, it looked clean and presentable. Our room was an entirely different story. It was facing outside by the pool. The light was already on in our room before we entered. Once we got in I was immediately disgusted. It smelled horrible (almost like a really bad sulfur), room looked very outdated and unappealing. Room was small, beds were old and I was so grossed out. I went to the front desk and explained how disappointed I was and they let me look at a few other rooms they offered--all of them terrible. We stayed put as there was no sense in moving to another awful room and quickly went to bed. When I woke up the next morning there were TWO cockroaches in the bathroom. YUCK! Southern California, I get it, bugs can happen. Every other hotel we stayed at for the rest of the week was so lovely. Very clean, up to date, and well kept. We had a few other family members that stayed in different rooms at this hotel and they were all equally displeased. STAY AWAY FROM THIS HOTEL. It ran me 135 after 12 for parking. We had 3 more rooms reserved at this hotel again for that Sunday but we canceled them immediately. Gross, outdated, smelly, and OVERPRICED. Never again will I stay at this hotel! BUYER BEWARE.

This hotel is not as nice as advertised. The room I had showed its age as it was looking dirty and worn. I also had one of the worst experiences I have ever had with the hotel personnel and management. Their customer service was very poor. On the second night of our stay the Toilet backed up a around 8:30 P.M. I called the front desk and was told there was no one who could fix it so I could move to another room. I declined this, as it would have taken at least an hour and a half to pack up, move, unpack and set up the room. My children were just going to bed so moving and doing the work would have been quite intrusive. I couldnt believe that they didnt have anyone who could plunge the toiled as this hotel has over 125 rooms. I asked if they had a plunger and the desk person stated he would look. He later called and stated that he couldnt find one. (really) I could use the bathroom six rooms down for the night. I advised that this was unacceptable, as it would be disruptive as the kids would probable get up a couple of times. He stated that no one else was there and the manager didnt answer the phone and he couldnt find the plunger. I went out and purchased a plunger. When I returned it took me all of 30 seconds to have the toilet operating properly.At around 9:00 the next morning I went in and asked to see the manager. She refused to meet with me and advised the employee that she was on a conference call and wouldnt be available to meet until 2:00. I found this to be ludicrous and told the clerk so. I felt like making a scene but didnt as my children were there. When we returned from our day at Seaworld around 5:00 I met with the manager. She told me that it was good customer service to only offer a room change. I advised her of how much work it would that would have caused, and how disruptive it would have been to the young children and that it only took me a few seconds to fix the problem after I went out and bought the plunger. I told her she should be embarrassed about the customer service, she advised that she was proud of it and all of her employees. I asked for information on the ownership of the hotel, or her manager. She only would give me the choice 1-800 number. She actually stated that she didnt have that information. I asked for the name of who hired her she stated herself, I asked if she was the owner. She again would only say she didnt have that information. Earlier I had asked for compensation for the situation she insulting only offered to pay for the plunger. In the room was a card titled commitment to your Satisfaction, It stated states that if youre not satisfied with our accommodations or service, please the front desk know so we can make it right. At this property from the general manager on down they do not follow this policy. They definitely did not make it right."},{"0":"Platte City","1":"32.76299","2":"-117.15919","3":"Quality Suites San Diego SeaWorld Area","4":"4","5":"I recently visited the area for Spring Break. This location was perfect. Close to all of the major attractions (Petco Park, Sea World, SD Zoo, etc). We were very close to the interstate but the location was very quiet. Shopping centers, movie theater, and numerous restaraunts nearby. We had issues checking in and the room type we booked was not available the first night. We were put in a smaller room but we did get a discounted rate for the inconvenience. Breakfast included hot items but they left a bit to be desired but my kids loved the make your own waffles (get there early or prepare to stand in line for quite a while). The outdoor heated pool/hot tub area was nice and well stocked with towels. The rooms were a bit tight (family suites) but they were very clean and the beds were comfortable. There are lots of families that stay here so there was constant noise from children running the corridors so if you are looking for peace and quiet this might not be for you. Overall a nice stay despite a few issues.We are glad that you liked the location of the hotel which is very close to all the attractions, walking distance shopping mall and restaurants. Thank you very much for appreciating heated pool. We very much appreciate and value your feedback and will share it with our team.

It was Memorial weekend, so understandably full of lots of families with younger children. The rooms were clean I appreciate the sheets covering the blanket and the fitted bottom sheet on the bed. Two areas in the room separated by glass doors. Two TV's, wi-fi, small frig and microwave:) Our internet rate was very reasonable for the area, especially considering it was a suite. They do charge 8 for parking most we have stayed at in the Hotel Circle area don't. The downtown hotels in San Diego almost all charge for parking, and charge a lot more. This is a pretty central location to get to all of San Diego's attractions. The breakfast was fairly standard, but is a good convenience to have to get something to eat in the AM before taking off to do touristy things.We sincerely appreciate you taking the time to submit your nice comments about your recent stay with us. We are glad you and your family enjoyed our suites with two separate living/sleeping areas and all their standard extra features. A survey of competing hotels in our immediate area found most do have a parking charge as we do, but we feel our competitive rates, unique room suites, and central location more than offset this. It is nice to know you enjoyed our free breakfast buffet. We are constantly adding new items and try to offer changing daily selections. Many of our guests also like that they can choose to eat in the breakfast room or on the adjoining patio overlooking the pool. We hope you had the opportunity to enjoy both and that you will choose to say with us again on your next visit.

I believe the best way for a hotel to do better is to let them know whats wrong. Overall I thought the hotel was nice and the staff was very helpful and this is good. There were a few hiccups, but I would probably stay again. (only if they fix the problems below)When I arrived Saturday afternoon, after my 4 hour drive, I really wanted to sit in the hot tub. I was told that it was not open due to some maintenance that needed to be done on both the pool and hot tub. I then tried to go into the hot tub the next morning and again was told it was not open and that it might be open later in the afternoon. I came back Sunday evening and it was raining, but the hot tub was finally open. So I sat in there while the rain came down and hit my face (not good and not long). Next I noticed the hotel had very nice flat screen T.V.'s in all the rooms that my family occupied. There was also HBO booklets next to the T.V.'s....only one problem. They did not have HBO or premium channels until the following weekend.. So I had to sit in a room with basic cable and no HBO or even the FX or History Channel. The breakfast was ok, but after the 2nd day I ate off site. The eggs were really watery and the sausage was as dry as beef jerky. The Orange Juice machine seemed to get worse each day, and on my third day it was like orange water. The elevator was extremely slow, and I think I could have walked up to my third floor faster. The elevators needed to be faster."},{"0":"San Diego","1":"32.76299","2":"-117.15919","3":"Quality Suites San Diego SeaWorld Area","4":"4","5":"This hotel is located in the Hotel circle area of San Diego. Please note being a San Diego resident, this hotel is not close to the downtown / gaslamp area or tourist attractions of San Diego. You are a good 15 / 20 minute cab ride to downtown. Most people stay at these hotels to be near the shopping malls. You will need a car to get around out here, the freeways around hotel circle are all over the place.The room itself is clean and big, but a little dated and the old wooden furniture could use a change, but understand that this hotel is more towards the budget end of hotels in San Diego, so its very decent for the price and surround by other hotels with a La Quinta property right next door.The breakfast is your average one with choices of bread, muffins and some scrambled eggs and sausage, coffee, or make yourself a waffle and some yogurts are available.The bed was pretty comfortable and i felt safe in my room and could not hear any noise from the neighbors. It's also nice you have a lounge area in your room to watch tv and relax and be away from the bedroom. The room also has a fridge and a microwave in them.Overall this is a good location if you need to be in Mission valley.Dear Guest,Thank you very much for leaving our property positive feedback on your recent stay with us. I am very glad to hear you enjoy our suites and all amenties we have to offer. Our central location to all major attractions is a plus but for some it is about 20 minutes out, which i think is still not to bad. Our Hotel recently changed names from Comfort Suites to Quality Suites. In doing so most items in the bed rooms have been replaced with new products from bedding, mattresses and a few others. Between now and March 2015 we should have all renovations complete. We hope to have you visit us again in the near future. Thank you again for the great feedback!

As mentioned in other reviews, some of the suites are quite small, although some of that is probably just due to having a divider in the middle of the two parts. It was nice having a divider between us and the kids, even if it was just a clear door. The one suggestion I would make to improve the property would be to have either clouded glass or curtains over the glass part of the doors so that they're not completely transparent. That way you can still watch TV after the kids have gone to bed without worrying about waking them up.While the rooms show some use, the property has been kept up well. The pool was clean and heated and there are some nice areas for eating outside in the perfect San Diego weather. The hotel is about 10 minutes from Sea World, Mission Bay, and downtown,so its a quick jump to everywhere, although the downside is that nowhere is within walking distance. The best part of the hotel was the staff. They were very accommodating when we requested a crib for the room and, after we left one of our phone chargers, they went to our room and called us when they had found it. Service like that is what makes this hotel go from just average to very good.Overall, this hotel is a solid choice, as long as you don't mind driving to the local attractions. Also, just as a tip, there's a parking fee for parking in the lot, however, you can park on the steet for free, as long as you can find a spot.Thank you for taking the time to complete our online survey regarding your recent stay at our hotel.Your feedback is very important to us and we can assure you that we will use this information to do everything possible to create an enjoyable experience for each of our guests.

It's in the heart of downtown, so we expected to hear city sounds from the room, but we slept well and comfortably in a room overlooking the street. The crowning grace, though, was the excellent and helpful staff. We forgot to make dinner reservations and was out shopping, but a call to the concierge got us an 8pm table on Saturday night in a highly-rated restaurant.

I can tell that the hotel is making serious strides towards improvement and the staff is seriously the highlight of the entire stay. They are wonderful and made us feel welcome during our entire stay. Besides the cleanliness factor in both the room and common areas, my biggest complaint is the bathroom has no countertop space. I love my toiletries and styling products and there was no place to put either. I ended up almost catching the room on fire because there is no counter space or even an edge of the sink in which to put my curling iron. I dropped my curling iron several times on the floor and it fell into the toilet at one point (hence the sparks and almost fire).Hi Ms. Adena B, I am sorry to hear that the room you stayed at was a little small for you.

We were 2 couples each with our own room. Upon arrival we were promptly attended to and checked in quickly. Vallet took our vehicle and we headed up to our room. The street it is located on is (Ellis) runs into Powell which is the main street the Trolleys run up and down. This hotel is located in Union Square, your really are in the middle of a great shopping center! Each side you walk you've got shops Adidas, Puma, Bloomingdale's, etc etc! A+ for Location!Once we entered our room, the only negative thing about this whole expreience was the smell of Freshly baked Subway Bread! Ha ha, I believe because of the way the hotel is built the center subway is one level with it's vents on there roof, there roof is also the first floor of the 5 story or so hotel, so it vents into the shaft of sorts and straight into your a/c unit. Big woop! Seeing as we don't like to hibernate in our room when this city is alive, it didn't bother us one bit, except when you woke up in the morning crazy a sandwhich (he he). We reserved a one Bedroom Suite. Upon entering it we were surprised to see how roomy it was. You first enter a living room with a miniature refrigerator, big enough to fit a 2-liter and some can drinks. The Tv is a good sized tv, everything is clean and neat. The couch is comfy as well as the Chair. They have these gorgeous Bay windows with seats built all around it so you can absorb the light if you so choose, cause there isn't much of a view! The bedroom is completley seperate from the living room, there is a door that divides it ( not too common with suites) The decor is exactly as it appears on the website, the stripes look overbearing at first but they are not I assure you! The bed was very comfterble, the sheets where clean. It was very pleasant. The bathroom had a Shower tub Combo, clean as well, no rust or grime build up. This room was a perfect gathering space for us and our friends, seeing as they had gotten a standard room I did look at it and it was very spacious as well.

If you've already committed to spend SF hotel money to stay near attractions, this isn't a bad spend.Pros: location - the Powell St. cable car ends two blocks away from you on the opposite corner of the block of buildings you would be in. Theaters and museums are mere blocks away. Bed - my goodness was this bed comfortable. I don't sleep well on most hotel mattresses, but I did here - which is good because I was here for a week! Wifi - complimentary and pretty good from my room. They have accessible rooms - which oddly enough I got, though I don't need it. Refrigerator in the room! Victory for me. I have medical needs for one, hate shelling out extra, and it is also convenient for keeping fresh fruit and other items cool so I don't have to shell out for the overpriced, less-than-great breakfasts nearby. Individual climate control - it does actually get hot in SF on occasion. The air conditioning did its job.Cons: location - there is a nightclub across the street and these windows don't appear to be double-glazed! They DO have ear plugs in the rooms and I was asked at check in if I needed a street-side or interior room. I was not facing the nightclub, but still got noise when the restaurant downstairs took out the trash at late/early hours. Age. This property IS renovated, but its age shows in spots, like in the wiring that's on the wall instead of behind it and closets that are ridiculously small. Air conditioning is by unit in the window. Some people don't like this (I do). Housekeeping: they didn't seem to want to replace things in the bathroom (i.e. washcloths, not soap) and the toilets are dual flush. Even full flush doesn't... um... always do the job. Ahem. Also, the panhandlers will be waiting for you. Don't head west on some of the nearby streets (esp Eddy). That is the Tenderloin. If you are looking for what the Tenderloin has to offer, well, then go ahead.The list of cons is longer, but I find fault easily - take it for what its worth. There is a popular restaurant attached to the hotel. I did not eat there (spendy), but it attracted a solid crowd in a neighborhood with a lot of competition. There are, of course, a ton of delicious places nearby and it is also around the same corner to the Powell St. Muni/Bart stations. If I came to SF for business again, I would consider staying here eventhough my worksite was not nearby."},{"0":"Chicago","1":"37.78527","2":"-122.40837","3":"Hotel Abri","4":"5","5":"The Abri is a nice boutique hotel. The location of the hotel is excellent. A couple blocks from Market St. I stayed during the Salesforce conference and I was happy to be in a quieter property that was close to all the major venues. The only very minor negative is the rooms were slightly on the smaller side. Or at least the room I had was. But the room was nicely appointed and it was similar to a hotel room you would get in Europe. Room size for me was entirely acceptable and did not make my stay any less comfortable. I would absolutely stay there again as I prefer boutique hotels versus the large chains. It's a nicely run and comfortable property."},{"0":"Pleasanton","1":"37.78527","2":"-122.40837","3":"Hotel Abri","4":"5","5":"We came into the city to celebrate our 25th Anniversary and stayed at the Hotel Abri.

This hotel was super convenient. Turn right within five minutes walk is the cable car and all the famous U.S. department stores, like Bloomingdale and Norstrom which are inside the big Westfield shopping mall, Walgreen, the supermarket is just in the neighbouhood. There is a Chinese restaurant and a Sushi place just cross the road. I love the bed in Hotel Abri, there were four medium size pillows on it and the bed was very comfortable. The room was very small but everything was in it, also the bathroom was very small, too. The air-condiitioning was the old-fashioned window ones, very noisy. It depends on what you are looking for, for location, this should be a good choice, everything is within walking distance and there is no need to rent a car because parking is very expensive in downtown San Francisco, valet parking in this hotel cost you US50 a day!The elevator was a bit scary, recommended to hold 4 persons! I saw some people choose to use the stairs. All the staffs were very friendly. There was free Wifi but it also depends what time, at night it is super-slow. My room was very quiet because I read the comments before booking this hotel, make sure you ask for the interior room and higher floors. There was a funny smell in the hallway but not inside the room. All in all, I think this hotel worth the money and if I want to stay in San Francisco downtown, I would surely book Hotel Abri again."},{"0":"Cleveland","1":"37.78527","2":"-122.40837","3":"Hotel Abri","4":"4","5":"I came in for a wedding and wanted to be in the heart of it all.

The hotel is very well managed, clean, and comfortable. Great showers and comfortable beds. We weren't in the hotel much as we were on a vacation and were busy running around but we looked forward to coming home to our hotel each night and finding dinner at all the local restaurants. It's centrally located to everything you'll want to see. We're very frugal people so we vetted many, many hotels. And finally settled on this one. So glad we did! Anytime we go back to San Francisco (which now we want to make a regular thing out of it) we want to stay at Hotel Abri. We even looked into their enrollment program to earn free nights...and we never do that. When we were initially debating whether to stay in the Fisherman's Wharf area or Union Square, we ultimately decided we wanted to be in the city...not a tourist attraction, so we went with Union Square. It was great to visit touristy areas but come back to local life. That said, Union Square is a huge shopping mecca so you could argue that its a commercial area. But the vibe feel much more local. This hotel is like staying Union Square in NY versus sleeping in Time Square...exactly how we wanted to experience San Fran."},{"0":"Fremont","1":"37.78527","2":"-122.40837","3":"Hotel Abri","4":"4","5":"The hotel is in a good location and the restaurant had excellent food.

I parked my car with the valet and didn't use it again until I checked out.The staff was genuine, friendly, and helpful. Sitting in the lobby with coffee and the morning paper was a joy.I want to know how and why the hotel smells like cookies, except in my room, which smelled fresh and clean.It was fun and restful, a hard combination to achieve."},{"0":"Durham","1":"37.78527","2":"-122.40837","3":"Hotel Abri","4":"4","5":"Stayed as part of our honeymoon trip for 3 nights. Checked about 10pm, wasnt the most friendly of greetings but hey. Had requested a high floor room, would have been nice to be wished a happy honeymoon but never mind. Asked when checking in if we had to pay for a safe or if it was in the room as we had a lot of flight tickets, money, credit cards, passports, iPads etc with it being a long trip, told it was in the room. Got to the room, no safe, rang down and spoke to the guy who checked us in who said oh yeah there is no safe in that room, a bit exhausting after a long flight from NY. Moved rooms which was fine, a bit small so no space for our luggage but a good spacious bathroom and the room was modern and clean. Reception staff quite disappointing, I have worked in hospitality and it wouldnt take much to say:- youve obviously just arrived, do you need help with eating tonight - we had never been to the city and being 10pm at night were unsure of where to go- we dont serve breakfast, do you need some recommendations- (when checking out with 4 suitcases) do you need a taxiNot much of an effort to help make our stay a little easierGood location, nice hotel, few niggles let it down"},{"0":"Nyack","1":"37.78527","2":"-122.40837","3":"Hotel Abri","4":"4","5":"Good location.

The building itself is old but the inside is modern and decorated in a boutique style.I booked this hotel based on the reviews on trip advisor and the location. We were staying in SFR for 3 days so wanted to be close to Union Square, which we were. The hotel room we booked was a suite as we travelled with 2 children. The room was fine, clean, modern. Slightly small, but we were in the room very little so it wasnt a priority for us.The staff at the hotel are friendly and very helpful. Ruben will get anything done for you and always with a smile. It does make the difference to be greeted by name and have happy and helpful hotel staff around you.The hotel has a restaurante and bar attached to it... Open to the public and with a good italian/american menu and an excellent atmosphere.There are 3 things that are worth mentioning I think:1. The hotel only has 5 floors so you will hear plenty of street noise etc.2. The windows are small and the aircon/fan units are noisy. Although we didnt really need them very much.3. There is no breakfast available during the week, but there is room service available from 11am onwards.

We showed up in a rush between meetings and the front desk informed us that we didn't have rooms any more because the people staying in our rooms had extended their stay! Hotel was supposed to find us rooms elsewhere but we ended up scrambling to find two other rooms. Disappointed as we always like to try and find the hidden jewel but this time we certainly found something else. Guess squatters rights still exist in San Francisco!Dear Nathan M-Let me first say that I appreciate you taking the time to provide feedback following your recent experience with us. Secondly, let me apologize and say that I wish that we were able to have accomodated you and your colleague at the Hotel Abri. Not being able to honor a reservation for a guest is the least desireable and most difficult situation for the hotel as well as the guest. We had a group of rooms extend that caused us a bit of a situation. I believe that when you arrived we were in the middle of securing accomodations for you at a neighboring hotel, but I understand how disappointing this was as you had already picked the Abri and we were unable to welcome you in the way we wish we could have. I hope that when your travels return you to San Francisco, you will give us a second chance. Please feel free to contact me or the hotel directly for future reservations, as we have a lowest rate guarantee, and always offer the lowest rate available thru any booking channel.

Then we changed the third time - this time we received a comfortable suit. Overall, the hotel is old a far from meeting standards of current architecture and design.

Trying to save money, I found a decent deal for a hotel that had good reviews here. While not going into further detail, but noting that I had difficulty in checking-in due to housekeeping being short-staffed, there was much issue.The BIGGEST issue I had here was with getting spider bites from sleeping on the sofa bed. After showing the front desk, and after their inspection came out negative, they moved me rooms, but that was it. I still haven't heard back from a manager and was not offered any sort of compensation.I would suggest not going cheap and staying at the Parc 55 across the street.Dear Luke H.,Thank you for your time and for providing us with the details of your experience while staying with us at Hotel AbRi, I want to let you know that I am aware of the multiple interactions/communications with you regarding your check in, stay and insect bites, I want to assure you again that we have followed up with the staff and pest control teams with the same procedures as we communicated to you at the end of your stay that there was no evidence of pests in the room, after our professional vendor inspected and treated the room, we also provided you with the findings and communication. I want to again formally apologize to you and your guests for the multiple interactions and confusion regarding the check in, as our check in time is 3:00pm, however we always try to accommodate guests requests, and our goal is to exceed each one of our guests requests and expectations, but unfortunately due to the high occupancy and number of guests, we were sold out the night before and also on the day of your arrival the requests are challenging to grant as our check out time is 12 noon. Also our apologies for the confusion on your reservation made by the third party which provided you with a One deluxe room with double double beds, not a two bedroom room, as stated, our front desk team did upgrade you to one of our Urban Suites to provide you with more space and a better stay for you and your guests. I am very sorry that even with the steps we took to upgrade your room type we failed to provide you a great stay, as this situation does not reflect our Hotel AbRis core values, style or caring approach, we totally understand your point of view, but we would like to let you know that our teams are diligently working with our third party partners to resolve these type of situations, so it would not affect other guests as it affected you. However this is not an excuse for the actions or scenario you described, during your stay we really tried to provide you with all the upgraded amenities our Urban welcome provides, but as we can see we fail on the communication and we will work on getting better. I can assure you that the sequences of events you have presented are not in any way, our teams guest service standards or company goals. I want you to know our leadership and service team have followed the procedures as we are truly concern and sadden by the details of your experience, and we want to again apologize on this format as we have done for the past days during communications with you. I would like to request from you another opportunity to further discuss and try to turn this situation from a negative experience to a positive, as we value our guests feedback. Please feel free to contact me directly at 415-392-8800, we are anxious to show you the caring, casual and family atmosphere we promote in our Hotel.

The room was very cramped with very little space besides the bed. The room also smelled weird and the staff were not helpful with respect to that.

Nice area to walk around in too.Dear slimmybim,Thank you for your time and honest feedback about your stay with us at Hotel AbRi. I am genuinely sorry to read about your disappointment with our guests rooms, specifically regarding the size, smell, and the welcome amenities provided as it seemed that our accommodations were not comfortable for your needs and no value added was provided to you during your stay also I am truly sadden to hear that our gift bag and selections were not well received, our sincere apologies, as we provide about 60 gift bags per day and we update our amenities every month with different themes and varietals, we wish you had informed us of your disappointment with the choice of sangria, so we could have addressed on site, as we have a great partnership with Local Small Vineyards and the relationship is very strong to provide our guests with the best possible experience.We are a currently following up with our housekeeping department on the strange smell, so we can ensure this situation will not surface in the near future. While the building structure is a historical building from 1907, and still maintains many of the architecturally historic qualities from the early 20th century including the interior corridors and original room layout, we are very proud of the overall quality, furniture and modern condition of our property. However this is not an excuse to justify your experience during your stay, we tried to provide you with all the amenities our property has to offer, but as we can see we fail on the delivery.

They didn't send anyone, so I finally went downstairs after thirty minute's to find someone, and it was the doorman that called the maintenance man for me.

Bathroom is pretty good size with 2 separate sinks. Location is superb! Walk to China town, North Beach and so close to Bart. My only complaint thus the reason for Very good vs. excellent is the noise level. The suites face the street, and with construction in the area which starts up at 7:00AM, it was LOUD. Construction will go on for a while since they are building a bart station. There is a bar close by and the shouting/talking at night can be deafening. Ask for an inside room to avoid this disturbance. If you must have a suite, then bring ear plugs.

The good things were the location, free wifi and the staff seemed nice. We asked for a quiet room when we booked and so glad we did. It meant no view but we slept well. It is a bit dated and there was a very odd smell to the room. Only one lift in use throughout our stay. Overall it did the job with no frills. Next time I think I'll go for something newer or with character. The lobby area seemed new and really smart, it didn't match the rooms.

We in this case includes myself, my wife, and our 8 kids. The kids have ranged in ages from 1 year old up to 17 years old (depending on the stay) and we have loved it every time.We have stayed in a suite each year and at least one (sometimes two) other rooms. The suite with the adjoining room is great for our needs.The location is perfect. Right near the Bart, right in Union Square. Need a quick bite to eat for a picky kid Subway is next door. Want a quick ice cream for a kid (or adult) quickly Cold Stone right next door, as well. And of course you are within about a 3 minute walk of 100 other restaurants of 35 different types.Why do we keep coming back to the same hotel with all the other choices SERVICE! This place just gets it. They put an emphasis on service that is difficult to find. There may be hotels with more room or for better prices. But knowing that we will be treated exceptionally well and knowing the staff will help us out with any questions or needs is worth the extra few dollars. My only complaint is that the suite has bathroom doors of frosted glass so you can see the silhouette of the person standing in the bathroom or getting out of the shower. Not perfect for a family, and also the door is sliding, no locks. Made more for a couple than a family, so communication is important to avoid any issues. Still, more than worth the minor inconvenience with all this hotel offers.Hello Mark B,Thank you for taking the time to share your holiday experience with us.

Understatement! The Hotel Abri was a stellar hotel staff is always glad to see you, hotel is kept in immaculate condition, bed was worthy of taking home if it were possible, and L'Occitane toiletries were teh OMGz.. Ginormous flat-screen TV also came with a connection for your laptop so you can use it as a monitor, clock radio also had an iPod dock attached. The only negative out of the entire stay (which the Abri can't really help) was facing another hotel I've visited previously which had a new club open up. And when you have late night clubs in a big city, you also get an occasional drunk being asked to leave said club for acting royally ASBO. Other than that, I'd recommend the Abri if you're looking to splurge a bit for a hotel not far from Powell Market, a major transit hub and terminus for the Cable Cars just a couple blocks away.."},{"0":"Baltimore","1":"37.78527","2":"-122.40837","3":"Hotel Abri","4":"3","5":"I was little worried about Hotel Abri at first. Its prices were much less than surrounding hotels which made me skeptical. However, immediately upon arrival, it was obvious that the hotel was just fine. The gift bag at check-in was a nice touch (especially the full-size bottle of whine). I had read the reviews and read about the gift bag, but I just assumed it included it one of those little whine bottles and a few other things. The room was small, but not any smaller than I would have expected for what was most likely an old apartment building turned hotel room. And definitely no smaller than 90 of the apartments you'd see in Manhattan. Despite the size of the room, it was well-appointed and had a decent size bathroom and shower. The rooms had window AC/heat units, but they were thermostatically controlled, which was nice (instead of just being a thru-wall unit with a speed knob. The morning breakfast bag left a lot to be desired (as compared to a standard continental breakfast), but it was better than nothing. They also give you coupons to the restaurant that connects to the lobby. We didn't get the chance to eat there, but it looked nice. Anyhow, there wasn't anything overwhelmingly fantastic about the hotel, not was there really anything bad. It was a nice launching bad for our activities for a long weekend. We walked to ATT Park for the Giants game (not far), and the cable car stop was only a few blocks away (as well as all of the shopping). Likewise, Enterprise retail car was just one block away (this came in handy because we rented a car to drive to Sonoma). All in all, a good experience, decent hotel, helpful and kind staff we would stay here again Fo Sho!Hello Matt B, thank you for your feedback.

Well, downtown San Francisco is a bit noisy, so I guess you'll have the same issues in any hotel there- one of the two elevators was broken, so there was only one, slow elevator serving the whole hotel. You could wait 10 minutes before getting it, so more than once I decided to take the stairs. However, this should be a temporary issue, since I saw they were working on it- the wi-fi was nearly useless--not only communicating via Skipe was impossibile (which might be understandable, given the bandwidth frequired), but also surfing the Web was a hard thing to do at times. This is really an issue they should solve, since it can be done easily and quickly- they don't serve breakfast. There's a restaurant (Puccini Pinetti) which is accessible straight from the hotel, however it opens at 11am, so you can only get a brunch. Anyway, no big issue: there is plenty of places around there where you can have breakfast.Price: I found a discount, so I think the price was fair, otherwise I would say it's a bit costy."},{"0":"Mexico City","1":"37.78527","2":"-122.40837","3":"Hotel Abri","4":"5","5":"Central to everything.

The room is small and only minimally functional for a group of four (I should've checked the footage before I booked a double room for four). We had a street-facing room so it was really really noisy at night given the frequent ambulance, passengers and especially the construction noise that went beyond midnight (I didn't know that construction was allowed after 11pm in SF). Service and notes in the room were a bit confusing and inconsistent. There was no introduction pamphlets describing services of the hotel, no sign in the room stating that the water bottles weren't free. Out of my four night stays, one night I did not have enough towels, one with water not replenished, and another without any coffee/tea replenished in the room. Other minor inconvenience include not having hand soap provided, and the hotel does not have shoe horns to lend out.

It wasnt a large hotel (4 floors) but it was perfect and allowed for a better guest experience in my opinion. The rooms were nicely appointed and extremely clean, very modern. They are on the tight side but that is normal for SF, so no big deal. The staff at this hotel were probably some of the best I have encountered in a while. They were genuinely nice and allowed us to check in 4 hrs early. They were also quick to ask us if we needed help finding restaurants etc. Location is great, 1 block from the BART station, great if you are arriving from SFO, or OAK. Cable car is also right down the street. Area was safe at all hours of the day, except for occasional panhandler but that is normal in every big city.Suggestions for guests would be to ask for an interior courtyard room as the exterior rooms face a nightclub and it can be noisy. If not ear plugs are readily available at the front desk.Overall this hotel is tops and I would stay here again if I am back in the city."},{"0":"Brooklyn","1":"37.78527","2":"-122.40837","3":"Hotel Abri","4":"1","5":"We arrived to check-in at 4pm. The person at the counter did not acknowledge us for 20 minutes while she casually talked to the customer in front. Then when it was our turn, our room was not available (and should have been ready at 3pm). When we arrived back later to settle in for the evening at 9pm, there was again a 10 minute wait at the counter. They gave us a gift bag for our inconvenience. The wine in the gift bag turned out to be rotten or corked. Now this bordered on absurd. The room itself was fine. When I asked to speak to the manager on our way out in the morning the receptionist said that he was not available, but would email me. It was truly a terrible example of customer service.Ms. Sara Z , Let me start this response by apologizing to both of you in regards to the overall experience you had at our hotel, as we can see we failed to meet your basic guest needs. Our goal is to exceed each one of our guests requests and expectations, but unfortunately due to the high occupancy and number of guests on Friday Saturday, we failed to provide you with personalized service and attention during your arrival and throughout. We are happy to hear that the upgraded accommodations to our Urban suite was up to your standards. Also regarding the gift bag and wine, our sincere apologies, as we provide about 30 gift bags per day and we have not had this situation happened before, we update our wines every month with different themes and varietals, we wish you had informed us of the wine during your visit, so we could have addressed on site, as we have a great partnership with Local Small Vineyards and the relationship is very strong to provide our guests with the best possible experience. I am sorry we missed you during your checkout, as our Manager on Duty was available and expecting you. We hope that you would provide us the opportunity to further discuss the details of your stay you can contact me directly at 415.392.8800. We look forward to your response.

In addition, the room we were given the next day was one of the smallest I've ever had, even though we had requested ahead of time to an upgrade. Told we didn't get the upgrade because we weren't there to check in. Throughout our four-night stay, one elevator was out of service and the other was very slow. We resorted to using the stairs to our third floor room. At checkout, we waited almost 15 minutes for an elevator because our luggage was too heavy to carry down the stairs. HOWEVER, for our final three nights we were upgraded to an Oasis Suite for no additional charge (beyond the night we were charged and didn't use). Very quiet, spacious room facing courtyard. Location is great for all SF tourist activities and shopping. Ate one night in the Italian restaurant. It was decent and the service was good. If check-in and the first night had been better, I'd give it a 5, but the poor first impression dropped the overall score. Hope both elevators are now functioning!"},{"0":"Houston","1":"37.78527","2":"-122.40837","3":"Hotel Abri","4":"4","5":"My husband, 4 year old, and I stayed at the Hotel Abri from Oct 11-14, 2012. The staff at this hotel were beyond 5 star with their service. They were helpful, honest, and really went out of their way to make sure you had what you needed. My daughter was taken with Tyler at the front, in particular! Aside from the service, the boutique hotel was fine. We had an urban suite, which had ample room. The two window units kept the place cool, and the curtains kept out enough light. My only complaint, and I mean ONLY complaint, was that the bathroom door was a sliding door, did not lock, and was frosted glass. If you have kids, you know that sometimes your only solitude can come from the few moments you get in the bathroom. My daughter had a grand time putting her face up to the glass and letting us know she was well aware we were in there, and I am thankful she never realized she could actually open the door. My husband would probably say that he didn't care for the fact that sometimes during the day you could smell Subway from downstairs in our room (on the 2nd floor), but we weren't in there much, and it was minor. The hotel was very convenient to the cable car that took you to the Wharf, as well as the BART and other public transport. There was AMPLE shopping in the area too.

Glad I chose the Abri, medium sized, clean hotel in a Union Square central location. My room was small but perfectly formed and the walk-in shower was powerful. My room had a strange smell to it during my stay which meant I had to have the window open most of the time for fresh air. Ask for an inner room to avoid noise from the busy street outside.I visited SF about 5 years ago so was shocked at the amount of homeless people everywhere this time round. Every street corner was filled with people begging so be prepared to have your dollar bills ready. Breakfast downstairs in the restaurant was good. Great shopping near by.

The personnel is nice and friendly, the room is clean, comfortable and nice.If you have some problem to sleep, you have only to ask to have a room not in the front of the street because during the weekend there is a local where the people go to dance we were so tired that we didn't have any problem about it."},{"0":"Zurich","1":"37.78629","2":"-122.40138","3":"The St. Regis San Francisco","4":"5","5":"In a city not known for sumptuous hotels, the St Regis is the local maximum. We stayed in a large, well-appointed suite with a nice view. We were somewhat disappointed by the fact that rooms are on the lower half of the bldg, as the upper half is reserved for residents. The result is that the W just down the street, while not of the same caliber, has infinitely better views. So, ask for floors 14-20. Below that, it s just too low.Second point of criticism - and this applies to all St Regis butlers: they creep us out! These guys need to be less awkward / better trained / older than 15. Now, for the good stuff: Nice pool area, very good spa treatments, and a rather hopping and pleasant lobby bar. The Japanese restaurant was also rather on the nice side. The location is obviously fantastic, with SF Moma half a block away, and all the shops a couple of blocks away.Overall, a relaxing St Regis - not their best hotel, but definitely the best in San Francisco."},{"0":"Sydney","1":"37.78629","2":"-122.40138","3":"The St. Regis San Francisco","4":"5","5":"When travelling for business, the thing you care most about is getting some sleep, being able to effectively work and having a functional room that takes all the friction and noise out of your day.

The St Regis met our needs in terms of a comfortable place to stay, from which to explore some of the touristy areas of SF. However, traffic getting into the hotel was a nightmare, partly due to Pride weekend when we were there, but in general it did take a long time to battle our way to the entrance every time we took the car out. Service was great at check-in, but when we asked for a kettle for the room and tea, it took about half an hour to arrive, with no tea bags. We don't generally enjoy the butler concept- when we asked for coffee, which was not available in the room like in other hotels, the butler charged us USD18. There was limited food options- a lobby restaurant/ bar and a second restaurant in the back. Food was extremely pricey. The pool was not something my kids wanted to use- a simple lap pool for adults. We are asked for the kids names and told the housekeeping would deliver something for them, but it didn't materialize, much to their disappointment. It is definitely geared toward the business traveler.Dear Globaltattler,Thank you so much for taking the time to share your most recent experience at the St. Regis San Francisco. We apologize that you experienced increased traffic over the Pride weekend, and that our Butler service did not meet your expectations. Here at the St. Regis San Francisco we truly strive to surprise and delight all of our guests, and we are always grateful for any feedback that will allow us to do that better.Please do reach out to me personally should your travels bring you back to San Francisco.Warm Regards,Andre BroseHotel Manager"},{"0":"Berlin","1":"37.78629","2":"-122.40138","3":"The St. Regis San Francisco","4":"4","5":"Got a nice room (1715) on 17th floor, but woke up three times at night because somebody must have run the tap or had a shower. When having a shower in the beautful seperate shower cabin, twice I adjusted the water temperature, stood under the shower for a minute or so when the water got really scorchingly hot and I had to move away from it, turn down the temperature, almost turning the water off, wait a minute for it to cool down, then feel it got really cold. Back to the original setting and eventually enjoy the shower.Sorry guys, at 490 a night that's not okay. Noise plus burning yourself is not acceptable.One more thing I hate: Monday night 7.30, I want to go jogging and ask for steam room/sauna after jog. Answer: it's part of our Spa and admission is 20 for hotel guests - and it closes at 8pm on a Monday. Come on, guys, that's not okay for a 5 Star hotel.

For example, when I called the front desk to ask about internet access, they informed me it would be extra, even though I could have sworn it was included in my rate (it was).

I spent a great deal of time selecting the hotel for this trip. After researching and considering many hotels, I chose the St. Regis. I was very happy with my choice. The location was great - it was close enough to every place we wanted to visit, without being in the middle of too much of the touristy crowd. Although our room didn't have the floor to ceiling windows I was expecting, it was nicely equipped and well maintained. I can overlook my disappointment over the absence of a panoramic view because of the amazing service. From the time we made our reservations to the time we left the hotel, the service was attentive and thoughtful, without being obtrusive. The concierge and guest relations people helped us with our wine tour, ferry and restaurant plans. The people at the front desk and in the lobby greeted us by name. Those at the restaurant, the Vitrine, were particularly kind and thoughtful. Kane was our server on most mornings. When he found out it was my birthday, he brought me a special breakfast dessert. To celebrate our anniversary, he brought us champagne and chocolate. The service made it truly a memorable stay. I'm sure that the service at the St. Regis will become the standard by which we will measure other hotels.Dear Kingtrips,Thank you for taking the time to share your review of your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco.

Location is perfect, just South of Market, right next to the Museum of Modern Art, across the street from Yerba Buena, Metreon, and a short walk to all of the Union Square and Market Street shopping. The hotel is modern and sophisticated, but also really comfortable and welcoming. We loved the fireplace that greets you on the other side of the front door, and the lobby bar is super chic with a lively scene. We loved the indoor pool! This is a great amenity for a city hotel, especially when traveling with a family. The pool is warm and there are tons of windows and natural light. There's a poolside menu for food and beverages. Grill is the contemporary restaurant that serves seasonal dishes with locally sourced ingredients. We are gluten free and they do a fantastic job with this - lots of gluten free menu options and the gluten free bread was delicious. We saw the beautiful house car (a Bentley), but our timing was off with it pulling away each time we were hoping to catch a ride (next time!). We were in a Grand Deluxe Guest room on the 20th floor, and it was amazing. Beautifully finished with high ceilings, big windows allowing for lots of natural light, plenty of space, huge shower, soaking tub, and amazing views over Yerba Buena.

To say the least, they go overboard.All the rooms are cleaned to perfection before arrival, I've stayed here a total of 6 times and have never found something from the room beforeRoom service is of 4-5 Star quality food, hot and ready and fresh.Do not tip the room service, the gratuity is already factored in.

Close enough to the Moscone center (5 minute walk) Staff were very nice and remembered our names, (somewhat) Very nice rooms and comfortable beds. They would clean your room after you left and turn down the beds right before you got back. Unfortunately sometimes the timing was a little off and they walked in while I was changing once and came in while we were there a few other times. It didnt bother me a whole lot but just be aware that if you don't want them to come in then put out the 'do not disturb' sign. Mandatory valet parking and sometimes we were waiting for that service. overpriced hotel bar, you might almost laugh at the prices unless you are made of money (I am not) but then again with how much it costs to stay there a night you probably wouldn't even wink. my view was of a construction sight but I wasn't in the room much so no matter. Never went to the restaurant. there is a pool on the 5th or something like that floor but we didn't swim. Would definitely reccomend if you are rich.

Overall, we still love this hotel--but we did experience a few hiccups with service that gave us pause. The hotel has already provided us with a complimentary stay for 2016 to make up for the problems this year, so we feel the hotel got the message and definitely has taken steps to make it up to us.We were informed of our upgrade from the Astor to Metropolitan Suite in an email from my Ambassador the night before arrival. Yet on arrival, they didn't have us in the Metropolitan Suite. After 25 min and showing the email confirmation, we finally were given the keys to the correct suite. This was a big hiccup, but since we got the upgrade I was willing to let it go.The suite and design of the hotel and and everything about it is still near-perfect for me. I love the design of the property, and the layout of the suites/rooms. I love its location in SoMa. I love the food/beverage, from the restaurant, room service and the lobby bar. Everyone is very friendly.We did have several housekeeping mistakes, and the management response to those was less than satisfactory. Even after our complaints, housekeeping still managed to screw up, something that I'd not experienced on any previous stay at this hotel. The fact that this was the weekend immediately prior to the Christmas holiday made me wonder if the property might be a bit understaffed or under-managed. We also had issues with wifi, both in the room (which was fixed in a few hours) and in the restaurant (which was fixed in about 20 min). We finally had issues with trying to reach our butler(s) on several occasions. We would call and it would ring and ring and ring with no answer on numerous tries. That was also another first for us at this hotel. We often had to call another department to be connected to the butler or front desk, and even then it took more time than it should have. That again made us wonder if the hotel was understaffed due to the imminent holiday period.Otherwise, again, we still love this hotel. Considering that we've had nothing but near-flawless visits here, we were and are most willing to give the hotel the benefit of the doubt. The fact that the hotel management awarded us a free 3 night stay for next December 2016 to remedy the mistakes of this visit more than made up for us for the lack of excellent service in the instances described above. We have faith that these were unusual slip-ups, and I still look forward to returning. I also have several business trips to SF planned in 2016, and I expect to be staying here for those, as well.Dear Bill R,Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts on your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. I regret hear of the delays in service that you received during this visit, and sincerely appreciate your understanding and loyalty to our hotel. We look forward to welcoming you back on several occasions in 2016, but please do not hesitate to contact me directly at any time.Sincerely, Anthony Duggan Hotel Manager 415-284-4057 anthony.dugganstregis.com"},{"0":"Durango","1":"37.78629","2":"-122.40138","3":"The St. Regis San Francisco","4":"5","5":"The St. Regis San Fran is a beautiful high-rise property in a great location in one of my favorite cities. The staff was highly-attentive, but never intrusive. The room service was phenommenal and always hot, delicious, and on-time. The beds and high tech window controls were wonderful too. I didn't get a chance to eat at Ame, but I heard wonderful things about the restaurant in the hotel. The bar area was always popular for cocktails and the gym was fantastic. I would highly recommned making reservations at Gary Danko for dinner, one of the best meals I've ever had! Also Boulevard and Postrio were fantastic and R G Lounge has amazing, authentic chinesse food. I also loved Taylor's Refresher along the Embarcadero for fun and delicious diner style food in an open, casual atmosphere.Overall, the St. Regis is the place to stay if you are looking for one of the best hotels in San Fran with luxury, privacy, and amazing service."},{"0":"Seattle","1":"37.78629","2":"-122.40138","3":"The St. Regis San Francisco","4":"5","5":"I'm a gold Starwood member and membership definitely has its perks. One place where you can definitely take advantage of great opportunities is the St. Regis in San Francisco. I've never had a less than stellar experience here. Stay in an Executive Premier guest room. Terrific value, space, design and comfort. Opt for the butler service -- always spot on and an amazing asset during your stay, from wake up service to the little touches, they anticipate your needs - the butler service is one of the hallmarks of the St. Regis experience. Gin and tonic Why yes, please.I stay at the St. Regis when I have friends in from out of town or when I just need a few days of aaaahhh time or when I'm returning from a long haul flight. I'm never disappointed. Ever. If you have the chance and the budget, do yourself a favor and stay at this truly world-class hotel."},{"0":"New York City","1":"37.78629","2":"-122.40138","3":"The St. Regis San Francisco","4":"5","5":"The staff were great. Christian at the front desk was terrific and truly offered a luxury experience. Housekeeping staff did a great job and were nice enough to run my wife's bath prior to returning to the hotel (several times, sorry). Private dining breakfast was not the best but again the attendant was very accommodating. We didn't have a chance to experience the spa and pool. Only negative feedback would be that the windows were not soundproof. Overall a very pleasant stay and would return."},{"0":"Philadelphia","1":"37.78629","2":"-122.40138","3":"The St. Regis San Francisco","4":"5","5":"It's unfortunate that I only stayed one night because this is a wonderful hotel. The room was so tranquil with neutral colors and simple yet elegant and comfortable furnishings. The bathroom is well appointed with a large vanity area and a deep soaking tub which fills quickly. It is open to the bedroom but with a panel that can be closed for privacy. The bed is so comfortable with the softest sheets. The staff is friendly and helpful. Having checked in somewhat late and being a Starwood member (which was acknowledged at check-in) a request for a (brief) late checkout was honored without any problem. I have found that in general bring polite and reasonable helps a great deal with requests like these. My rate included breakfast which was fresh and plentiful. The service at Vitrine was friendly and quick. I was not there long enough to try the spa, pool or fitness facilities but the look great and I hope to go back for a longer stay and try them. My only complaint about the hotel is the cost to park. The valets are quick and friendly but that doesn't entirely justify over 50 to park for overnight. Also, and this is just a general gripe, I encountered a few spoiled and rude fellow guests who seemed to think that paying a premium for a hotel room entitles them to slam doors and be generally disruptive in public areas. It's just a general wish that people would be polite and act appropriately. I won't blather on about staying on some of the world's best hotels, blah, blah, blah. However the St. Regis San Francisco in my opinion ranks with those in terms of location, service, amenities and comfort."},{"0":"Seattle","1":"37.78629","2":"-122.40138","3":"The St. Regis San Francisco","4":"5","5":"What can I say it is the St Regis. This is a newer building and everything is done with taste and thought. From driving up to walking into check in, to your room. Decor: Very contemporary, but comfortable. Unlike the W which goes for modern mostly the St. Regis San Francisco keeps it clean and contemporary yet tasteful and comfortable. Great earth tone colors and tasteful art through out the building. Food: They have a lobby lounge which is great for just hanging out, having a meeting, or wanting to have a little snack. Nice atmosphere not too quiet, not too loud. They have Art of Tea which is served daily between 2-4pm and reservation are recommended, and finally their restaurant the Grill which is a contemporary dining. Beautiful dishes, great tastes and really if you just want a nice dinner without leaving the hotel you really can't go wrong, but again you are in San Francisco.. Rooms: Well the rooms as I said are amazing. Very clean, very contemporary but comfortable. huge windows allow you to see amazing views of the city and parks. Everything is automated, the bathrooms are large and comfortable. If you like the finer things in life, or want to take your partner on a romantic night this is it. Staff: Again A+ the entire experience was amazing including their staff. The butler service was on point and I really have zero complaints.. A+Dear petewright09,We appreciate you taking the time to share a review about your recent experience at the St. Regis San Francisco. We are thrilled that you enjoyed the guestroom dcor, our culinary offerings and felt well accommodated by our staff and butler service.

Hotel is about 5 minute walk from the Montgomery Street station. Arrived at Noon - room was not yet ready. Front Desk attendant took my phone number and said they would call when room become available - but they never called. Not a big problem - I went out and enjoyed the sights. Came back around 3:30 and was then able to check-into my room. Was given a north-facing room on the top floor (top floor of hotel, that is - the upper floors of the building are for the St. Regis Residences). Room decor was very serene and calming. Never heard anything from outside or other quests while I was here! Bathroom was especially nice, with lots of room, wonderful amenities, rainforest shower and separate soaking tub. Everything in the room seemed fine, except for my master-control panel - some of the features just wouldn't work (phone, radio control, etc.) - I never called for assistance, just got by with using the other phone (think there were four phones total in the room). Bed and linens were OMG spectacular. Slept like a baby and felt wonderful when I woke up!Took any early morning swim in the pool - very nice - and it was great that the pool is open 24/7. Fitness center was well-equipped, and super clean.Ate Breakfast at the hotel restaurant - which was lovely, but quite expensive. Lobby bar and main restaurant looked lovely, but I didn't have a chance to experience them. Visited the Museum of African Diaspora which is accessible from first floor of the hotel - very nice place. The hotel has a great location for visiting the fine arts museums - many within a block or two - Yerba Beuna Gardens, Jewish Heritage, Museum of Modern Art. Also just a couple blocks from the high-end shopping of Union Square.If you are seeking a space of serene luxury in the heart of the SF hustle and bustle, the St Regis definitely delivers."},{"0":"Newport Beach","1":"37.78629","2":"-122.40138","3":"The St. Regis San Francisco","4":"5","5":"My husband and I just returned from yet another wonderful stay at the St Regis San Francisco. Three nights again in a beautiful and spacious Metropolitan Suite with proper blackout shades installed in 2016 per my request. Air con was great as always. Had our dog with us again, too.Service and food/beverage again were fabulous. Spectacular Platinum recognition, as always, due both to my Ambassador level status and the fact that I stay here many times every year. (I'll be back again in late August.)The only misses were:(1) Concierge had sloppy mistakes confusing our party sizes for bookings at 2* Commis and 3* Saison. Created a bit of confusion and a little exasperation when arriving at Saison and booking was under wrong name. Settled but stupid.(2) Twice had calls to butler ring way too long before anyone picked up. Pet peeve of mine.(3) Room service didnt have pork sandwich as per menu for a lunch order, then brought my chicken sandwich ordered without avocado...but with avocado--and not toasted fully. Stupid and not impressive. Replaced quickly and whole lunch order was compd.Obviously, the service recovery was wonderful in each instance. But those are mistakes that this hotel doesn't usually make.Still, we had a truly fabulous stay with amazing service otherwise. Everyone knows us by name. Butler service was fab. Packing and unpacking were great. Pressing and shoe shine were done with aplomb. Great service at the amazing bar, at the restaurant for breakfast, from the front desk, valets, everyone.This still is my favorite hotel by far in SF. And it now ties with the StR NY as my 2 favorites in the whole of the USA.Dear Bill R,Thank you for taking the time to share your review of your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco.

I confirmed that we'd receive a double bed room in a few days ahead of our arrival, which was the same afternoon of the wedding.I called at 2:00pm that afternoon, an hour before the official check-in time of 3:00pm and the front desk told me they were finishing up our room, took down my cell phone number, and would call me when it was ready.We arrived around 2:30pm, stepped up to the counter to check-in at 2:50pm and our room was still not ready. OK, we thought perhaps a few more minutes ... which ticked away, and away, and away! My wife went back and asked for our room because we had to get prepared for the wedding! While the desk personnel were apologetic, they tried to offer a handicap accessible room, which we did not want. Then they tried to blame the situation on the fact that we had booked a king room on the reservation block for which they had already written and confirmed we reserved. The clock is ticking past 4:30pm ... and finally we get our room keys!We hurry outside to where our bags have been sitting on a luggage cart, tell the attendant that we have our room and need our bags immediately to prepare for the wedding, now about 1 hour away! We thought our bags would arrive on the heels of our entering the room, but NO ... again waiting ... so we started to prep the younger girls ... still no bags!My sixteen year old daughter went back down stairs and found our bags had not moved! She was livid ... and finally got them to start moving the cart. It was 5:15pm by the time our bags came. I understand that porter was just doing his job, when he asked if he could set up our bags in any particular place or if we needed ice, or how to operate the room controls ... but at that moment our immediate needs were for him to get the bags in the room as fast as possible and to leave so we can dress for the wedding! We all rapidly threw ourselves together ... my wife having triple duty ... in order to arrive a few floors down for the wedding.The entire experience of checking in was horrendous. From the call to confirm at 2:00 pm until we got our room and finally our bags! Not one of the hotel staff exhibited any sense of urgency for our situation. To appease us, they offered and we accepted to park our car onsite for a free night.On an afternoon full of anticipation for seeing family and friends at the wedding and reception (also at the St. Regis) ... we went through a tremendous amount of stress from that check-in experience. We're seasoned travelers so we can and have handled the ups and downs of travel ... in this case, I had to double my normal 24 hour rule for posting a negative review, because I'm still fuming. A five star hotel such as the St. Regis should never have their guests wait 2 hours past their own published check-in time to access their room.Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for sharing your thoughts on your recent stay at The St. Regis San Francisco. I sincerely apologize on behalf of our entire staff for the extended delay upon arrival to your room and the multiple inconveniences that were caused to you and your family.

(How did we ever travel before Trip Advisor) Loved our time here. We requested and were given a quiet room - on the 17th floor. Everything about the St. Regis is stylish and modern (though not as great as the St. Regis in Manhattan). I loved the TV in the bathroom. Minor annoyances - the tv remote didn't work - probably dead batteries there was no price list for the overpriced wine in the wet bar - it took 20 minutes to have one sent up the electronic control center on the nightstand acted up a few times, turning the lights on in the middle of the night and I find it annoying to be charged extra for the wi-fi use (15/day). Regarding a couple comments posted earlier about the hallway carpeting, I loved it - a really fun design element. (will post a photo of it) We had the best meal of our stay in the hotel restaurant. The lap pool was warm and beautiful and empty - unfortunately I forgot my suit. Too bad the spa didn't have a basic suit to sell, like they do in some hotels. I would happily stay here again.

The Warf is a great area, but it is all tourists. When we go to SF, we like to walk (a lot) and visit the places the locals go. The Hotel Vertigo is in a great location for branching out all over the city. And, on those days when you just want to hang out - there are plenty of restaurants and bars within blocks. Hotel Vertigo is a seven story boutique hotel. Over the last couple of years I have made the decision to only stay in boutique hotels, and Hotel Vertigo does not disappoint. The rooms are small, but very well appointed. It is apparent that my room had recently been renovated with modern chic. The bathroom was huge with a great rain shower head. The room was on par with some of my recent stays in Madrid and Mexico City. Excellent WiFi coverage all over the hotel. My only complaint was that I had an inside corner room (709) on the 7th floor that adjoined another room. The door to the adjoining room was not very sound proof so I almost clearly heard TV and conversation in the next room. This was only a problem one night for about an hour before a fell to sleep after a long day of exploring the city. The staff here are amazing. They were always ready to help us with directions, taxis and recommendations. The rooms are cleaned very quickly each day with great detail. My friends have been staying at Hotel Vertigo for years and I'm glad they convinced me to stay here this time. I'll be back in a few months with my girlfriend and I know she will love the Hotel Vertigo.

Beds are very comfortable and rooms are clean and good size. Only complaints about the room are lack of a comfortable chair and the dresser. The dresser is in the closet and is difficult to access which is annoying during a long stay. There is no exercise room (supposed to be coming) and no business center or conference room ( also supposed to be coming).Would stay again, but just aware of limitations."},{"0":"Whitehorse","1":"37.78858","2":"-122.41593","3":"Hotel Vertigo","4":"4","5":"We stayed here for five days in the beginning of November. The location is fine for exploring San Francisco, close to transportation and only about ten minutes away from Union Square. The staff were very helpful and friendly. Our early morning wake up call for the half marathon was as requested. We really enjoyed our stay. The coffee in the lobby is great for early mornings.Thank you so much for your review and the compliments about our location, coffee and our friendly staff. I'm delighted that you had a good stay and that you had fun running the half marathon. We look forward to having again.Jaime GonzalezFront Office ManagerHotel Vertigo"},{"0":"Akershus","1":"37.78858","2":"-122.41593","3":"Hotel Vertigo","4":"3","5":"The hotel has a central location and we stayed here in October 2011 (room 301), therefore we booked again this year. Some upgrades are required such as the Wifi which was very slow or did not work at all(room 601). The beds are very comfortable, but the technical standard is not in accordance with the high room rate. Shower system should be changed in order to save high water consumption (general water restrictions in California).Nice staff Vidar A. B,Thank you for sharing the details of your experience both positive and negative during your stay. I have contacted our Internet provider as we had an upgrade completed 3 weeks ago increasing our bandwidth along with wi-fi upgrades to meet the higher demands and usage of internet. In the future when making reservations please feel free to reach out to me directly for assistance at jgonzalezhaiyi-hotels.com.

Friendly staff and quiet rooms (though no view) it was a great base and one I'd be tempted to use again. It's central Ian big US city so yes they're small but otherwise very good. Staff lovely and location excellent - worth wandering up Hyde or Polk to union for some lovely SF fun. Only downside was that they don't have a car park but they have a good deal with the secure public lot at 840 Sutter - just 200m away.Dear Matt W,Thank you very much for your review of our hotel.

Rooms were unique. Hotel was very clean. It's not a 5* hotel but staff was so very helpful. Free wi-fi in the room. Very nice location! Walked to chinatown and Union Square. The only complaint: We were offered a breakfast with our rate and the yogurt was warm. They just had a boxed breakfast sitting in the back room where It should be in the fridge. It's better to go 2 doors down to the breakfast place. It's inexpensive and the food was good. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. The men that worked the front desk were the best.

Only good surprises: Very nice staff, used to deal with international visitors and making the effort to speak other languages. Rooms are a little small but their design is tasteful. We had a comfortable bed, enjoyed a quiet sleep with almost no noise. If the hotel does not provide breakfast other than Coffee or tea, there' s a chinese 'diner' type at the next corner that will fulfill your needs for cheap.I ll go back there for my next trip in SFDear NicoCT,Thank you so much for offering your comments.

I'll start with the good. Good:Check-in we were greeted by Sean. He has his customer service skills down! He was always friendly and willing to help. He told us how to work the shower. This saves people time so they don't have to call asking how it works. Easy to work, but I would not have known how to use it right away. So pay attention! He was able to put us in a room before check-in time (Which is at 3pm) we arrived around 11am. So everything was fine in our room. Something to note: when people close their doors its loud. There was noise in the night when sirens went by. But it was okay because our room was towards the back. Its location helps in that there isn't that much traffic so its less noisy than a hotel closer to Market St. (Our first trip to SF we were right off Market and we had to use earplugs) Free WiFi. One of the big reasons we chose this hotel was because it came with a mini fridge. We were able to store our food and water in there. Bad:On our last night I had just finished flossing and was throwing it away. I was leaning to spit into the sink as I am doing this a big cockroach is climbing out. This freaked me out and I screamed there's a cockroach. My sister who I am sharing a room with tells me to call the front desk. I do and ask if they have RAID or a bug spray he says no that he would send someone up. A man comes up I tell him where I saw it. He checks the whole bathroom and doesn't find it. I ask again if they have a spray he says no and says something about how they don't have those here (Meaning they don't have cockroaches). Then as he didn't find it he says what threw me over the edge You know your eyes can play tricks you. When he said that to me I just stared at him boiling inside and didn't say anything. After he said that I told my sister I was not going to speak to him anymore. To make a customer question what they saw and make them feel like they are crazy is just wrong. This upset me more than the cockroach. He told us to calm down and he said again that your eyes play tricks on you. My sister responded by saying she believes me and he proceeds to say if we want to change rooms in a tone you could hear he was getting mad/irritated by the situation. My sister informs him that it is our last night plus we were already in our pajamas ready to sleep (this all took place 11pm-12pm) really late. So my sister decides we sleep with the lights on. I don't know when my sister decided to dim them. But like an hour later my sister wakes up and she spots it near our bed. She tells me to call again. This time I reached for my glasses and my phone first. Ready to take a picture because the man did not believe me the first time. The cockroach went back to the bathroom and my sister followed it and watched where it would go. I called they sent the same man and he came in and my sister told him where it was. He then said he got it and said sorry and that his supervisors would not be happy. I didn't say anything to him. This took place at like 1-2 in the morning. We didn't sleep well which sucked because we had to catch our flight that morning. I'm giving them an average rating because everything was fine until that last night...Dear espy610,Thank you for your detailed review of the amenities and the friendly staff that assisted you throughout your stay. I have passed on your compliments to Sean and I want thank you for the opportunity you gave me to resolve your issue. As our reviews indicate we strive to provide superior customer service, impeccable rooms and make all of our guests feel that we have exceeded their expectations. Per our conversation please reach out to me in the future for reservations if your travels lead you back to San Francisco.Regards,Jaime"},{"0":"Johor Bahru","1":"37.78858","2":"-122.41593","3":"Hotel Vertigo","4":"4","5":"Stay for 2 nights on October with my wife. The hotel decoration is very classy, from the lobby up to our room. Check-in and check-out is very smooth. Location wise, even it is close to some major attractions (Union square, etc) but also close to Tenderloin which make us feels a bit insecure (not their fault btw). Only problem is on our last day just before check-out when we waited for the lift for nearly 10 mins. We've got to drag our heavy luggage and found out that the lift is out of service. At least put some sign on each floor that the lift is broken. Otherwise everything else should be ok.Dear Andai,We are so fortunate to have you and your wife as our guests this year in our hotel. We thank you for taking the time to leave us your review. More importantly, we are glad our staff was able to have a smooth check-in and check-out for you. We do apologized for the lift breaking down on your last day with us, we do thank you for your feedback and we will definitely take the appropriate measurements on notifying people when it breaks down next time.

Although the Vertigo has no restaurant , there were plenty of places nearby to choose from. It was cheap, clean and had free Wi Fi. The staff was courteous and helpful. The rooms did lack adequate drawer space and were a little small. The bathroom was cool- I liked the rainhead shower and the H20 products and the flat panel TV. I would still recommend The Vertigo to anyone wanting a inexpensive place to stay with personality."},{"0":"Seattle","1":"37.78858","2":"-122.41593","3":"Hotel Vertigo","4":"3","5":"Although this hotel could use a new coat of paint (which it appears they plan on doing in the new year), our room was clean, quiet, comfortable and inexpensive. I think the age of the hotel added to its charm and set it apart from most of the hotels I generally stay in - giving it character. It was definitely unique and the staff was very nice. They even upgraded our room upon our arrival. I definitely recommend this place if you want a location that is relatively close to downtown/union square without paying for the price of a downtown/union square hotel."},{"0":"Philadelphia","1":"37.78858","2":"-122.41593","3":"Hotel Vertigo","4":"4","5":"I really liked this hotel and the nice little features in the room. Also, it has a decent gym and the location is also good, maybe 15min walk to Union Square. On the other side, if you are in the wrong room, you can hear your neighbours talking. Even though, the hotel wasn't booked out and they had plenty of rooms available, they put us in the room next to the elevator. During that night, I didn't sleep more than 30 min. After complaining, they gave us a different room which was much better. But why not giving us a quiet room in the first place!Dear Tim E,Thank you very much for your review I am happy to hear that we were able to accommodate you in a quieter room resolving the noise issue. I am also happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay, and we hope you will be returning soon to the Hotel Vertigo.Warm Regards,Jaime GonzalezFront Office ManagerHotel Vertigo"},{"0":"Melbourne","1":"37.78858","2":"-122.41593","3":"Hotel Vertigo","4":"3","5":"I want to like the Vertigo Hotel. It's quaint. It's charming. It's off the beaten path. And its staircase has a Hitchcock movie connection. It is one of many renovated small hotels in San Francisco. I like boutique hotels. While it's several blocks from Union Square, I easily walked it. Its a bit closer to the Tenderloin and I suppose the nearby grittiness adds to the charm. It's a neighbourhood hotel, not in the middle of the city and touristy madness. The staff know the area and make good suggestions for restaurants and things to do.With respect to usability, especially for business, it leaves a lot to be desired. The wifi is slow. It is shabby and worn. At one point the Orange in the lobby was bright and modern. Now it is faded. Check in includes instructions on how to use the shower because it is not obvious. The website says parking is available but fails to mention it is either expensive valet or several blocks away. In the final analysis, while adequate for business, it is better suited for visitors on holiday. I am glad to have had the experience of staying there, but will probably choose another hotel for my next visit. And yet it remains charming."},{"0":"Tonsberg","1":"37.78858","2":"-122.41593","3":"Hotel Vertigo","4":"4","5":"Stayed a weekend. Good facilities and friendly staff.

What we found was a rather worn and tattered, rock-n-roll hotel with a dated atmosphere. The room was clean, but again, a little worn. The service was okay, but our room was not ready when we arrived a bit early, but we were told it would not be ready for over an hour AFTER check-in time. We were able to check our bags at the desk, and we went for an early cocktail, but chose another place once we saw the kind of seedy bar. Room service was quick, but the food was just average. I have a feeling this outpost of the W brand is in for a major shakeup. The price of rooms here is high, and I just don't see why. We also stayed at the Hyatt Olive 8, and the experience was MUCH better. I would skip the W Seattle. You will not get what you pay for.Hello JJHappyTraveler, many thanks for your recent review on your stay at W Seattle. We apologize that we missed the mark with you and your partner.

We were most impressed with the bar - friendly service and great menu (tater tots poke plate were fab!). Booked a spectacular room with a view. View was just looking at a big building (see pic), not a cityscape like I hoped, but I suppose thats the nature of being downtown. Probably would save money on that next time. No fan in bathroom so there was some humidity in there. I also requested a 4pm check out but they could only do 1pm. No big deal and wed still stay here again.

The hard product isn't particularly special, but my entry-level room was decent, with a comfortable bed, good lighting, conveniently located power outlets, and modern yet unoffensive decor. The view wasn't bad either, with the Space Needle visible in the distance as well as a comfortable couch by the window. In contrast, the bathroom was mediocre, with a shower/tub combo, relatively weak water pressure, and sterile design compared to the rest of the room/hotel. I did have to call to request slippers as I couldn't find any in the room, but they were delivered swiftly.In the past I have steered clear of W hotels due to the impression that they are more style than substance, but the service here was actually very good. I was warmly greeted upon check-in by the friendly clerk, and the concierge desk was also more than happy to recommend some nearby places for a quick dinner (I ended up going with Heartwood Provisions, which was excellent).Hello Oliver L, thank you for your review on your recent stay at W Seattle!

It was my first time staying at a W hotel property and am definitely going back. From the first point of contact at the front desk (I think the woman who checked us in was namedMikala), to the restaurant staff, and housekeeping - everyone was so welcoming and kind. The rooms were very modern and clean. Good amount of space and great amenities. Hotel is conveniently located within blocks of Pike Place, restaurants, and shopping. I prefer to not stay too close to Pike Place because of the crowds. Starbucks is located right across the street, which is great if you need coffee every morning. Not sure when I'll be back in Seattle, but I'm definitely staying at another W property soon.

That said, this W seems to lack the pop that other W's have. There's nothing special, trendy, or quirky about the rooms. .. a bit of a disappointment. I was also a bit put off by not having a coffee pot available in the room. Although there was coffee available in the lobby, I prefer to get up and make my own. No big deal.

I got a mega suite which overlooks the bay and the city and had a great leather chair to look out the window. The property is in line with most W's, hip, with upbeat energy. The only downside is there is no Bliss spa. The Trace restaurant offered a wide variety of great food. The bartenders were on point, fast, friendly and attentive. The MOD, Anthony was very kind in fixing an issue with my bill, as well as Bryan, who checked me in. Tyler, the bellman was extremely efficient with my luggage at check-in and check-out. I will definitely stay again. Breakfast was very good as well as the service. The housekeeping was on point daily and cleaned my room when I requested, which is not always the case in a lot of SPG properties.

This time, we decided to make a night of it and stay at The W Seattle. Received a pre-stay message from W Insider, Mykaela, with great dining recommendations near the hotel. As it was our first night away from our baby boy, I replied back to Mykaela to see if she could set up a special surprise for my girlfriend. She replied back and was excited to help out with my little request. When we arrived, we were welcomed by Rachel, who was inviting and funny, and got us into our room. When we entered the corner room with a west view, right on the desk was a amenity and card from Mykaela, wishing us a happy anniversary, along with the little surprise for my girlfriend a stylishly framed picture of her and our baby boy so that she wouldn't miss him too much. After checking in and refreshing from the drive, a short walk took us to Century Link Field, just in time for kickoff. After a win for the Seahawks over the Eagles, we walked around the city, popped into a little Mexican joint for dinner, then back up to the room to enjoy the city view and Stellina Di Notte amenity.The next morning on our way out, as we were waiting for the elevator, the room attendant on the 17th floor greeted us from another room and thanked us for staying. Nice acknowledgement.At check out, Mykaela was at the desk and got the chance to thank her in person for the personalized service. Stored our bags for the morning to grab brunch, before heading back up to Vancouver. Short but really sweet stay. Thanks W Seattle...and Go Seahawks.WOW, what a fabulous review, and I am thrilled that we were able to make it special for you both! And we agree, Mykaela IS amazing, and we are thrilled to have her on our team! We appreciate you staying at W Seattle, and we hope to see you back next time you are in the city!

Good bar and attentive service and they mix a damn fine martini. If you're looking for any sort of view at the end of the day - take a 3 block walk to the waterfront and enjoy - because there's not a view to be had from your room.(we had 6 people there in all different rooms) It is a great location - close to most of the best spots in Seattle. The rooms are comfortable, but not worth the non-corporate rates. I would have been embarrassed to charge breakfast on my corporate card because it was so overpriced. So avail yourself to one of the many coffee shops.Hello Michael C, thank you so much for your feedback.

Upon arrival, Nina (super sweet and friendly) assisted us and let us know that our room was not ready yet so they stored our luggage and said they would email us when it was ready. We never received an email but headed back around 4pm and it was ready. They had defeathered the room per our SPG profile and even upgraded us to a Cool Corner Room. I was so excited! Their W Insider (concierge) had emailed us prior to the trip and asked if we were celebrating anything special. We told them it was our anniversary and he was able to upgrade us as a surprise. Along with the upgrade, was a bottle of champagne on ice and some homemade gummy bears which totally put a smile on our faces. That's hospitality at its finest. The room was super clean and the view was amazing with 4 large windows. The room also had a really nice chaise lounge that couple be separated into 2 seats or combined for 1 lounge. It was really comfy. The W mattress is also really comfy and I liked that the bed was lower to the ground. The AC was also really quiet which provided us 2 nights of really good sleep. In the evenings, they had live music in the Living Room and after 9pm they had a DJ so it was sort of a party atmosphere at night but no noise could be heard from the room aside from city street noise. Overall, we had a great experience. The staff always greeted us when we walked by and the valet guys always opened the doors for us. I hope to visit again soon!PS- it's a 6 block walk to Pike Place Market. No need to rent a car as everything was within walking distance.

Good and convenient location. About 15 minutes walk to Pike Place Market and 5 minutes to many shopping stores. Lots of restaurants/dining options nearby too. Stayed in a Spectacular room which were fairly spacious and modern. I liked the Bliss product toiletries in the rooms. There is a Nespresso machine in the room. They didn't have any tea/kettle though. Staff were friendly. Their whatever/whenever service is pretty efficient. Now for some of the cons. The temperature in the room was difficult to regulate. Every tiny adjustment would make the room either too hot or too cold. There aren't enough towel bars or hooks to hang towels in the bathroom. The gym was unkept. Noticed some used towels and opened water bottles laying around. Upon check out, we requested for a bellman and followed up two times and no one came. Ended up bringing everything down ourselves and noticed bellmen in the lobby who apparently weren't aware of our request. They were pretty friendly so not sure if it was just some miscommunication between the hotel staff. Had a good stay but not sure if I would stay here again because I wasn't wowed as much as I thought I would be staying at a W hotel.

The water pressure out of the shower head was incredibly poor. The check-in experience was awkward since I couldn't hear well, as I had a late check-in (10pm), and the check-in desk is located in the loud hotel bar, which was pumping with bass and loud music. It was sincerly shocking that Emma, the pleasant check-in receptionist, asked if I would be willing to forego daily cleaning service in exchange for 500 Westin points per night! It's bewildering that this arguably 'five-star' hotel would even suggest such an option for their guests. I'll likely be trying other hotels in the neighborhood on future trips that will hopefully have stronger, more satisfying water pressure.Hello WillinLa, thank you so much for your feedback on your recent stay at W Seattle.

Love that you can walk everywhere but overnight parking is a bit pricing. I requested a view of Elliott Bay and pay a little extra to get the higher floor for the view, it was disappointing - NO VIEW! Overall the stay was comfortable and love the cleanliness of this hotel!"},{"0":"Houston","1":"47.61276","2":"-122.3333","3":"Grand Hyatt Seattle","4":"4","5":"We stayed in two rooms for one week. The hotel IS IN the convention center. Had I know this, I would have booked at a smaller place. As a result, it was very crowded and there was no real personal attention. The rooms were clean and offered lovely views. Club level was worth it. Sadly, my young son lost his treasured baby blanket at the hotel. (we think in the laundry). And there were many many tears over that. I think more from me! We asked several times with several people, but it was never found. We are still heart broken."},{"0":"Portland","1":"47.61276","2":"-122.3333","3":"Grand Hyatt Seattle","4":"5","5":"We stayed here over New Years to celebrate our anniversary, and the hotel went out of their way to make our stay pleasurable. Not only did they provide great service, but we also had a killer view of Pike's Place and the Space Needle from our room. It's also in a great location where you can walk to everything (note though: parking is 30 a night in their parking garage, so you may want to find parking elsewhere).

The Pike Place Market, which is a must see, is a pleasant 10 minute stroll down the hill. Other tourist attractions e.g. the Seattle Wheel, the Aquarium etc, are approx a 20 minute walk. There are plenty of quaint places to eat including the larger franchise eateries close by.The rooms themselves are spacious and well equipped. The bathroom has a walk-in shower as well as a bath. There is a writing desk as well as a chair and ottoman, so you are able to relax and put your feet up.We were on the 27th floor, with a water view room. Nice outlook of Puget Sound."},{"0":"Los Angeles","1":"47.61276","2":"-122.3333","3":"Grand Hyatt Seattle","4":"4","5":"The Hyatt is situated right in the city.

My work colleague had a huge bath instead in theirs.Would definitely recommend."},{"0":"Coeur dAlene","1":"47.61276","2":"-122.3333","3":"Grand Hyatt Seattle","4":"4","5":"My husband and I booked a room here over the past Thanksgiving for two nights when we flew in from North Idaho to celebrate the holiday with our son and his family. The room was comfortable and had nice amenities. Ruth Chris Steak House is attached to the hotel which serves fabulous meals. Expensive but very good quality. As with most Seattle hotels parking is very expensive-around 45 a day and even 30 to self park so our son picked us up when we arrived and then we took a town car when we had to return to the airport. 65 included tax and gratuity and was arranged by the hotel concierge, Molly, who was most helpful. She also told us about the train to the airport but when she said you have a half mile walk from the station to the airline counters we declined. Only around 3.00 so if the weather is good (ours wasn't) and you don't have a lot of packages (we did) it would be the way to go. You can catch the train only two blocks from the hotel. The hotel is in a perfect location for shopping, eating or theater going in Seattle. Very close and easy walking distance to major stores and lots of wonderful small ones. Also located next to the convention center so very convenient for that too. We were disappointed to come back from shopping at almost 2:00 and find our room had not been cleaned as yet. We also did not care for the heating system. It has a vent at the top of the wall and when it came on it blasted your head with cold air when you were in bed. Don't understand why it was cold as we had it on heat. These were the only two negatives and we would definitely stay again. Our room was very quiet except for when the idiots in the corner room next to us let their door slam about 12 times around midnight. I was just about to call the front desk when it stopped. They had a nice business center and allowed you to web check in for your flight for free but charge to use the internet."},{"0":"Treasure Island","1":"47.61276","2":"-122.3333","3":"Grand Hyatt Seattle","4":"4","5":"The staff at this hotel always exceeds my expectations.

Grand Hyatt and the Sheraton. I had stayed at the Sheraton, which had a nice jacuzzi on top, but wanted to try the Grand Hyatt. We pulled in, had a room readily available, and went to our room. The bathrooms are huge and my wifed loved this. No complaints about the room. The hotel had a nice gym where I was able to workout in the morning with a few of the LA Angels prior to playing the Mariners. Very nice gym with a connecting jacuzzi area. They also had a sauna and a very large and hot! steam room. Connected to the hotel is a really nice Sushi restauant, which if you like sushi, you should check this out as the dishes roll around the restaurant on little conveyer belts. They also had a NY deli style place to grab sandwhiches and a Starbucks. I would stay here. They guys running the valet are very professional as you could tell they know their stuff. The front desk check in was very pleasant. But, one word of caution...nothing to fault of the hotel but more the city of Seattle. My wife and I fell asleep Sunday night around 8pm, thinking we were going to wake up and head out to a restaurant. At 12:15 am, I was out of luck to getting any type of food. Room service closed, so the only thing I could purchase was small little crackers and cookies from the front desk. Not a big deal, but you would think in a city that size you could walk to some place and get a sandwhich. In the morning, I didnt see breakfast, so I think it was all room service. BUT, dont eat there, walk 6 blocks to the Pikes Market and go to Le Panier or Poscky's for pastries. Wonderful Go there early and beat the lines! Eat breakfast at Lowells for crab-dishes."},{"0":"Atlanta","1":"47.61276","2":"-122.3333","3":"Grand Hyatt Seattle","4":"5","5":"I first stayed at the Grand Hyatt Seattle soon after it opened about 8-9 years ago. I remember loving the hotel. It was new and modern and in a great location and ever since I've always loved it. I recently revisited it and was worried that it could now be showing its age. I'm happy to report that these worries were completely unfounded, the hotel is still amazing. There's a Ruth's Chris Steakhouse in the hotel, as well as a Starbucks and a sushi restaurant. The staff is very helpful. And the location is great for anything in downtown Seattle, either business or pleasure. But my favorite part of the Grand Hyatt Seattle are the rooms. They are modern and I just love the layout of them. As others have reported, the bathrooms are huge, and the whole entry area of the room has stone floors instead of carpet. The views from the upper floors are also amazing, especially on an unusual clear day. I had room service twice and each time it was good and came quickly. Overall, it's a great hotel. I highly recommend it."},{"0":"Austin","1":"47.61276","2":"-122.3333","3":"Grand Hyatt Seattle","4":"5","5":"I only stayed for 1 night but it was great.

We wanted a place with a bathtub big enough for two but unfortunately the tub was not big enough for one. Room 2920 was comfortable and had a view towards the west with Elliott Bay in the background. You will hear noise from traffic below. I was also disappointed with the thin bath towels. You'd think a place this nice with these room rates would of offered better, thicker towels. The very large shower had some black mold in spots that contrasted with the white marble. Charging for bottled water seems cheap too. Self serve parking 30/day is a bit steep. Seems to me that they could give guests a discount on the parking fees."},{"0":"long island","1":"47.61276","2":"-122.3333","3":"Grand Hyatt Seattle","4":"5","5":"Just completed a one night stay at the Grand Hyatt Seattle. We were very happy with everything and can't complain. The staff was professional and courteous. Everyone from the front desk staff to the housekeeping staff was friendly and always greeted us.Jason checked us in immediately and was extremely nice, efficient, and welcoming. The house keeping staff does a great job in keeping the rooms clean. The decor was modern, the bathrooms beautiful. We were upgraded at no additional charge to a corner suite, maybe because of our Platinum status or maybe because it was a monday. The view was amazing and we loved the electronic blinds and huge room. There is a great shuttle run by Gray Line that takes you to the hotel for 17 dollars round trip, 10.25 one way. We only took the shuttle from the hotel which left at 15 minutes past the hour and 45 minutes past the hour. It was right on time and took less than 45 minutes including two stops at other hotels prior to arriving at the airport. Much cheaper than a 30-40 dollar plus tip cab ride. We have gone to the restaurant Brooklyn on this trip and our last trip also. The entertainment book provides a buy one get one free coupon for it and the food although pricey is worth it. The entertainment book provides many buy one get one free coupons to local attractions including the art museum, Victoria Clipper, aquarium, and others. The hotel is in a good location to attractions and shopping.Pikes market is a straight 10-15 minute walk from the hotel. It is right next door to an awesome movie theatre and the Cheese Cake factory. If you can get a great deal this is a hotel that I would go back to."},{"0":"Portland","1":"47.61276","2":"-122.3333","3":"Grand Hyatt Seattle","4":"3","5":"I absolutely agree that the location is great. You can take the Metro from the airport, get off at the Westlake Center and walk three blocks to the hotel. Convention Center is 2 blocks away. Here are the pluses and minueseROOMI upgraded to a King view room. Suppose to be a nicer room on the 24th floor or above. The room was the exact same room with the exact same view as a friend had on the 21st floor. What I will say is the bathroom is fabulous. Soaking tub and separate shower, large vanity, robes. But the quality and quantity of the towels didn't live up to the rest of the bathroom. FACILITIESThere is no restaurant, no bar, nothing. There is a Starbucks around the corner. Its very odd given that the hotel has a small conference center. There is a Ruth and Chris' Steak House next door but the bar there is very small. And a major downside is that the lobby smells of cooking meat from about 3:00 on.Great work out facility. One of the best I've seen.Executive lounge is okay but doesn't have the amenities of Hilton, marriott, Westin etc. BREAKFASTWe had a AAA package that was suppose to include a full breakfast. It turned out to be that a very small continental breakfast in the Executive Lounge with an additional chaffing dish of eggs and a meat CUSTOMER SERVICEIt was okay during the stay but had major trouble with my bill. I got charged 3x the room upgrade. I called in to customer service and told that I was mistaken on the cost of the upgrade and that there was no way I could have gotten information to the contrary because it would mean a flaw in the reservation system. Fortunately, I still had a copy of the e-mail that showed the correct amount. When I sent it in I did not get an apology or anything even though I explained how challenging it was to have to deal with credits etc. with my company. Still waiting for the credit to show up on my card."},{"0":"Amarillo","1":"47.61276","2":"-122.3333","3":"Grand Hyatt Seattle","4":"5","5":"Checked in the day before leaving on an Alaskan cruise.

I would expect no less of a hotel of this caliber. What blew me away was their friendliness and hospitality toward our one year old baby boy. When they found out we were traveling with a baby we were placed in a beautiful corner room with a separate area for our son to sleep. Anyone traveling with babies will understand how valuable this is! You can hear the traffic noise on the street below but we traveled with a white noise machine that blocked the noise. We requested a travel crib and they delivered the crib already assembled with extra towels and wash cloths and a set of travel size Johnson and Johnson bath products.

With that said, the lobby is nicely designed as are the rooms. But half of the hotel has bad views regardless of what floor you are on. A few times we requested extra towels and a few other items like laundry service and each time the staff promptly helped. That was appreciated. So was the quick check in. The rooms are a little tight but the furniture, especially the bed was comfortable. The towels in the bathroom do not know the meaning of soft and that was a bit disappointing. I am highly attuned to smells and the room was overwhelmingly fragrant upon arrival. This is something that I could have done without. As is the ridiculous fee for the wi-fi. In this day age it is insulting when a hotel charges for this service. It feels like they ought to charge to use the alarm clock while they are at it. If it were not for the Internet charge I would give this hotel a 4-star rating. But the charge feels like a thorn in my side so they get a 3-star rating."},{"0":"Highland Park","1":"47.61276","2":"-122.3333","3":"Grand Hyatt Seattle","4":"5","5":"We were given a beautiful room overlooking Pike's Market and the Bay.

You can ignore the complaints about the price of parking, because there is no need to bring your car here. All of the downtown attractions are within easy walking distance, as are the train to the airport, light rail to Lake Union, the monorail to the Seattle Center, and buses to pretty much everywhere else. If you're allergic to transit, the hotel will call a cab or car service for you. And if you truly enjoy driving in traffic, there are cheaper places to park nearby. Be sure to ask the concierge for information on discounts to museums and events. If you want to work out, the gym is fabulous, with lots of high-quality cardio and weight equipment. Bring your swimsuit so you can enjoy the sauna, steam room, and whirlpool. And, although as a rule I don't believe in room service, especially in a city with such good local restaurants, the breakfast that we ordered in-room compared favorably to the best food we had anywhere else - good fresh fruit, excellent bread, local cheese, perfectly-cooked eggs delivered hot, top-of-the-line condiments and a not-too-sweet yogurt parfait. Really, you can trust me.

Very friendly staff from concierge to housekeeping. We stayed on the concierge floor and ate breakfast there each day - food was great and service was wonderful. This is a well run hotel in a great location. Would definitely recommend it."},{"0":"Newport News","1":"47.61276","2":"-122.3333","3":"Grand Hyatt Seattle","4":"4","5":"This hotel is located a few blocks from the Westgate Link station, so you can easily get around Seattle. Pike Market is a short walk and you can even walk to the waterfront if you like. Check in service is excellent, the front desk and the hotel workers are always friendly and willing to help out. Room is very clean with a large bathroom. My only complaint is the ice machines are not located on all floors, although the hotel says they can someone up with some ice for you. Also the safe in the rooms are located on a high shelf in the closet, see pictures, if you were a short person not sure you could even use it.The hotel does not have its own restaurant, you need to walk next door to the Ruth Chris to eat, but they were open for breakfast. There is a Starbucks and a small convenience store near the hotel.Although the hotel had some minor issues, I would stay here again next time I visit Seattle."},{"0":"London","1":"47.61276","2":"-122.3333","3":"Grand Hyatt Seattle","4":"5","5":"What a great hotel and a fantastic city.

Location is Grand, Check in was Grand, room was Grand and the Club was Grand. A shout out to Louise the Concierge, I will call her the Grande Dame of the Grand Hyatt for helping us book a luxury wine tour at the last minute. When you book on the Club level you have a choice of a room with combo bath and shower or a walk in shower. The walk in shower is pretty Grand.

Living room, separate bedroom, large bathroom and closet. Great location at the east side of downtown by convention center, near the freeway, light rail to the airport (and underground stations for downtown buses), and Capitol Hill. Room was quiet, clean internet 9.95 a day. Hotel was modern decor, lots of wood, pleasant atmosphere. Ruth Chris is in the lobby, very good for lunch (didn't have breakfast or dinner there, so many other good choices nearby). Would definitely consider staying here again (though I'm a SPG Platinum elite)."},{"0":"Sedro Woolley","1":"47.61276","2":"-122.3333","3":"Grand Hyatt Seattle","4":"4","5":"We enjoyed our stay at the Seattle Hyatt.

Upgraded reservation to club level to have access to grand club which essentially provides breakfast and evening snacks and beverages. Worth it. Pro: location to downtown and walking distance to Pike's market. Grand club breakfast was outstanding. Gym, sauna, and hot tub are fantastic. plenty of places to eat near by Cons: 30.00 self park, 50.00 valet parking.

The rooms are nicely appointed and very comfortable. Compared with other major cities the prices are reasonable. It's easy walking distance to local attractions, plus it's just a short walk to the Monorail station that goes to the Space Needle.Thank you so much for your review! We are so glad that you enjoyed your stay and that the room and property amenities made your stay a great one.

I stayed in this hotel because I was attending a conference. The rooms are greatand I am picky. The bathroom was nice with granite/marble (who can tell the difference anymore). Bed was great. Nice size room. Really nothing negative to say. I am typically a boutique hotel kind of guy for vacation, but if you are looking for a nice hotel in downtown Seattle, this is not a bad option. I stayed at the W before I moved to this hotel. I liked this hotel better than the W. Quite a statement coming from someone who has stayed at several W hotels around the world and recommend them. If the rate is decent, consider this option. It is typically that big hotel feel, but worth the stay."},{"0":"Chicago","1":"47.61276","2":"-122.3333","3":"Grand Hyatt Seattle","4":"4","5":"I stayed at the Grand Hyatt because I was attending a downtown Seattle conference and it was one of the selected conference hotels, although not the main hotel. I was upgraded to a corner king suite the room was very nice, and convenient since I was with my husband. Two separate rooms always makes life easier on the road, especially for a longer stay.The overall look of the hotel, including our room, was very fresh and pleasant. Very clean as well. We like the fact that many Hyatts now share space with Starbucks--very handy and a nice low-cost option for breakfast.The hotel lived up to our expectations, which were not too high since it is not positioned as a luxury hotel, in most ways. We did find the service a bit off. It seemed as though there were too few staff available to help--long lines at check in and out--but then that may have been a result of staying over a holiday weekend."},{"0":"Helena","1":"47.61276","2":"-122.3333","3":"Grand Hyatt Seattle","4":"4","5":"Great hotel in the center of Seattle.

We paid 35 for overnight parking. Once you get parked just walk everywhere, I love walking around Seattle.The only complaint I had was the pet fee changing from the time I booked it until the time we actually stayed. The fee had gone up 50. I didn't complain or say anything because I just didn't feel like having a dispute about it. I also wish they'd had an area for the dogs to do their business, luckily I always carry poop bags, but my Dog had to go very suddenly on the street because I couldn't find a green space close enough, so I just picked it up of course.I guess with big cities it's harder to have an outdoor area for pets.Now to all the great things, which was pretty much everything.The lobby was beautiful, nice lighting, everything was clean, there were large hallways and huge ceilings.Our check in was quick, easy and friendly.We were given a room on the 29th floor with a great view of the city.The room had huge windows, it was a really clean room, spacious and beautiful.The bed was really comfy and also very clean.The Bathroom was massive and I really mean that, it has a gorgeous soaking tub, walk in shower, toilet and vanity area. You have lots of amenities with this hotel.There is a nice hallway space and an awesome do not disturb button that turns a light on and you don't have to hang something on your door, loved that.We had food and drink options that were attached to the hotel in the front, which is always nice for a quick and easy option.We ordered room service with our TV remote. The breakfast that came was delicious, very prompt and with friendly service.We slept amazingly with the fantastic bed and black out shades.When we came back into our hotel on the Saturday afternoon/evening before the show we got on the elevator with a Seattle Mariner, that was pretty cool.Everything about our experience here was perfect from the moment we arrived to the moment we sadly left.This was a bit of a splurge but I hope that one day we can stay here again.I also wanted to add that every staff member I encountered was always friendly to myself, my DH and our Dog.Thanks for a great weekend in Seattle for the show."},{"0":"Middletown","1":"47.61276","2":"-122.3333","3":"Grand Hyatt Seattle","4":"5","5":"The Grand Hyatt in downtown Seattle offers an extremely comfortable a spacious room, with a nice view from the upper floors that face west.

The hotel is beautiful, trendy with very good service. It is just across from the convention center and has a Ruths Chris (that even serves breakfast), a Starbucks, NY-style deli, and Blue C Sushi attached. A Cheesecake factory is on the corner of the building but not attached to the Hyatt.The doorman, valets, bellman (especially Jazz), front desk and maids were all very good. We chose a club room which served a decent breakfast but seemed to skimp on the variety of food items for the evening appetizer drink session. The club room did have very nice computer stations, TVs, chairs and couches, and a fantastic view.The room was certainly large enough with a very comfortable king-size bed. What disappointed my wife and me was that the desk (i.e. the place to put your computer, cell phone, etc.) only had one available wall plug, hidden and inconveniently located behind the desk. Most hotel desks have lamps with electrical outlets in their bases, or several outlets purpose-built into the desk. Not so with our desk just a plain desk and one hidden plug. Also, only every third or fourth floor had an ice machine. When I needed ice (which was daily so my wife could ice her post-op foot) I had to go from the my 25th floor room to the 28th floor - or call for ice and wait.They also only provided two glasses for the room and no paper/plastic cups. We prefer to use two glasses for drinks and have two in the BR. When we would bring glasses down from the club to put on the bathroom counter, they were consistently gone in the morning. Moreover, the towels were remarkably thin and limp, not what youd expect from a high-end hotel and they only provided two hand towels and two not-so-large bath towels. (The towels at the Staybridge Inn and Hampton Inns where we also stayed on our trip were much larger and more plush and each gave us four of each.)We were surprised and disappointed that Hyatt would cut corners on the Club food, towels, and a decent computer desk. Otherwise, we had a nice stay and would consider staying there again."},{"0":"Lubbock","1":"47.61276","2":"-122.3333","3":"Grand Hyatt Seattle","4":"5","5":"The Hyatt Seattle was a wonderful choice for our conference.

The rooms are spotless, beds are incredibly comfortable, staff is nice. The gym is incredible, with personal TVs on every machine and ice cold towels to cool off with. The location is great, with shopping every way you turn. While my husband was in business meetings, I kept myself busy roaming the stores in the area. It is an easy walk to Pike's Place Market, which is a must-see experience! So many awesome vendors with unique items to sell. It's the only place I have ever found something personalized with the correct spelling of my daughter's name. :) It was my first visit to Seattle, and I had a wonderful time. The hotel was perfect in every way. I would recommend to all.Thank you for your review. It sounds like you had a great time!

Very comfortable, well appointed with all you'd need (and expect) from a Grand Hyatt hotel. Convenient location in centre of downtown, close walking distance to office district, shopping, great selection of restaurants and 20 min walk from wonderful Pike Place Market. In-hotel restaurant is top end qualify, if slightly pricey, but good for breakfast. Service throughout the hotel is excellent, especially the guys out front who call you cabs.Tip for alternative breakfast option go to deli shop linked next door for great sausage muffins/ bagels coffee - delicious and served by lovely people.In summary, a great hotel from which to enjoy the city of Seattle!Thanks for your comments!

Asked to speak with someone with authority, asst. manager now involved. All I can say.... thank goodness reservation was booked thru an executive / director with the Hyatt chain.... Or we would of been screwed royally.Checkout was a disaster. Credit cards presented and staff unable to handle splitting the charges to two credit cards. Not only do they charge full amount to both cards, but do it twice. Trying to correct was a nightmare. Once back in Canada, numerous calls and numerous employees in Accounting involved. With the exchange on the CDN dollar, I'm still out of pocket for their error.Plus side, never again. Avoid this property. Other great properties in the vicinity that I'm sure offer better service!!!!!!To management, suggest additional training required for your front desk and accounting staff.

But the Hyatt was spectacular: We entered and we were greeted by Michael at the front desk on check in, who when he learned that it was our anniversary sent up some champagne and chocolates, the view from our room, the fabulous workout room (basically a nice gym with sauna and whirlpool), a beautiful bathroom and just a feeling of ease the whole time contributed to our relaxing visit. The workout space was heaven (and I usually hate working out but I enjoyed it here). You can also use the spa and workout space at the hyatt across the street which is even more extensive.We got free wifi too which is something you don't always get with business hotels. It is near the convention center which in some towns can be in a funky area of town. We were just a few blocks from Pike's Place Market, A good retail shopping district seemed to surround us and it was easy to get around.I would definitely recommend this to anyone wanting a more upscale stay."},{"0":"Cottonwood Heights","1":"47.61276","2":"-122.3333","3":"Grand Hyatt Seattle","4":"4","5":"I attended a conference for 4 days. The room was ideal for what I needed. The upgrade to a suite allowed for business to take place in my room without a bed in the middle. The bathroom was fantastic as noted by others. I enjoyed the fitness area, although a little confined relative to the size of the hotel and the fitness-minded Seattle population. The cab ride isn't bad and is under 50. I had colleagues that did the train for much less money and minimal trouble. Walking distance to great restaurants and the riverfront made the location very convenient."},{"0":"Bethesda","1":"47.61276","2":"-122.3333","3":"Grand Hyatt Seattle","4":"5","5":"Elegant and contemporary interiors without being gaudy.

Room size is comfortable for a hotel in a city, its bathroom is quite spacious. The only thing about this hotel is the reception staff. We were checked in by a stone-faced male staff at the front desk, and checked out by a female staff who was not friendly at all. If I hadn't met other people in the city, I would leave Seatlle with an impression that people there are rude and cold. Thankfully everyone else I met there were friendlier than Grand Hyatt's front desk staff.Seattle has a lot to offer I'm sure I will come back here - but probably not to this hotel."},{"0":"San Diego","1":"47.61276","2":"-122.3333","3":"Grand Hyatt Seattle","4":"5","5":"The bathroom (size,soaking tub, walking shower stall, robes) is in the same league as Bellagio but with a bit extra...complimentary toothpaste, cotton balls/q tips. Yes, they even have a coffee maker (which Bellagio doesn't offer). The same with both hotels, electronic sensor frig, move anything and it will appear on your bill. There's a Starbucks downstairs off the elevator. So convenient to the name brand shops and restaurants. It was enjoyable. Got complimentary wifi for our stay. The electric shade works very well. We requested a late checkout ( 1 hour) but wasn't granted one. There's a complimentary umbrella to use in the closet in case of rain. Safe in the closet."},{"0":"Philadelphia","1":"47.61276","2":"-122.3333","3":"Grand Hyatt Seattle","4":"5","5":"My husband and I arrived a day early for our cruise to Alaska. I tried to find a centralized hotel where everything would be within walking distance of the hotel. We were greeted outside the hotel by very friendly hotel staff. The simple expression by the hotel staff to greet me by my name is well worth my visit. The hotel room was clean and very comfortable. The bell hop made it a point to go over everything in our room, give us his name and make a quick get away. The hotel was in a perfect place to walk Pikes Place, the Space Needle and all the shopping venues around the hotel. The martini bar around the corner offered some really good Bloody Mary's and buffet breakfast.

The room I stayed in was clean and well appointed with a radical view of the city. Where they truly shined was the breakout sessions they put together during my conference. The food for said breakouts was tasty as well as thoughtfully and artistically displayed. One breakout had all food floating, on mini boats, around a moat the had made in the common area."},{"0":"Greendale","1":"47.61276","2":"-122.3333","3":"Grand Hyatt Seattle","4":"5","5":"This hotel has what it takes to enjoy a Seattle exploration. It is surrounded by every area one must visit within a city that has so many facets to admire. The property has all of the amenities...a Starbucks, a steak house, a deli, a sushi bar, and a great fitness center to work them off. We walked everywhere with ease, and watched the world from a panoramic view from our picture frame window. To say that we were pleasantly surprised would, well, cover it....Thank you for your comments. We love that our central downtown location makes it easy for our guests to explore all that our great city has to offer. It's also great that we can offer all you might need without even leaving the hotel. We would love to have you back with us on your next visit to Seattle.Sarah S.Guest Relations Manager"},{"0":"Seattle","1":"47.61276","2":"-122.3333","3":"Grand Hyatt Seattle","4":"3","5":"We stayed at the Hyatt for a Christmas party. The room was everything you would expect from a Grand Hyatt. Updated, clean and comfortable. Check in was a nightmare. It took us at least 40 minutes. 3 people at the counter and only one of them was checking in anyone. We knew several of the people waiting in line. Two of them were sent to rooms that already had people in them. Then they had to come and wait in that 40 minute line again to get it straightened out. This sort of service is not what you would normally associate with a Grand Hyatt, especially with the rates they are charging. The Gold desk was not open and the concierge just sat there and did nothing to help either. The valet station was not operating smoothly either, both for check in and check out. All in all, the front of the house here needs some help."},{"0":"Pinckney","1":"47.61276","2":"-122.3333","3":"Grand Hyatt Seattle","4":"5","5":"We had a lovely Christmas staycation at the Grand Hyatt Seattle (seriously, we took the bus from our home in Redmond to get here).We were greeted with a hot chocolate and christmas cookie bar... as well as an upgrade to a water view room!The hotel is within walking distance to all of the main downtown sites. We ordered room service for breakfast and were happy with our waffles. There is a Starbucks right downstairs, so we got coffee from there and brought it back up for a Christmas Eve treat.The workout room was really high end and clean. There was also a sauna and hot tub - I wish I brought my swimsuit!The Grand Hyatt made our staycation overnight stay very special."},{"0":"Rochester","1":"47.61276","2":"-122.3333","3":"Grand Hyatt Seattle","4":"4","5":"We were here recently for a business/pleasure trip. Business in that we did not pick the hotel but the meeting picked it. We were pleasantly surprised. The hotel is very nice, super convenient to everything, staff was outstanding and the room was clean and comfortable.

Check in was quick and painless, and they gave me an upgrade per my Globalist (ugh, it pains me each time I type that) status to a corner suite. It was on the back side of the hotel (away from the Sound view), but it was a spacious room with the necessary accoutrements. The bed was comfortable, and the housekeeping staff was friendly. The club had a better spread than some other locations, and ample seating. Otherwise as far as restaurant outlets in the hotel, they had a Ruth's Chris (didn't go) and a deli/convenience store. There's a bunch of places within walking distance though, covering all types of cuisine, and it's very easy to get to the tourist attractions not too much of a jaunt to Safeco Field either.Would definitely recommend."},{"0":"Tampa","1":"47.61276","2":"-122.3333","3":"Grand Hyatt Seattle","4":"3","5":"We stayed in a corner suite. I liked the setup of the suite which had a separate work area from the sleeping area. The bathroom was a good size as well. I also thought the cleaning staff did a decent job.What I didn't like: 1) the bathroom has some mildew issues in the shower that needs to be addressed and the tile grout throughout the bathroom needs to be cleaned/bleached as it is showing its wear and lack of cleaning. 2) on the last night of our stay I guess we finally got a next door neighbor and when I tell you the noise from them taking a shower was soooooooo loud... it was borderline unacceptable and really pissed me off. I had to turn the tv up to hear what I was watching. If we had heard that the 1st 2 nights of our stay I would have definitely complained but given it was our last night I left it alone but decided to post this review. 3) view of city was not that great. Our view was mainly of the top of some building and you could see a small part of the water Overall the hotel was ok but what really annoyed me was how loud our neighbors shower was while we were trying to turn in for the night. I don't know that I've ever stayed at a hotel where I could hear my neighbors shower that clearly (and I've stayed at a lot of hotels). This is Completely unacceptable!!!!!"},{"0":"Los Angeles","1":"47.61276","2":"-122.3333","3":"Grand Hyatt Seattle","4":"4","5":"Stayed for three nights at the Grand Hyatt over Labor Day Weekend. Originally booked on the 29th floor in a beautiful room. As stated in other reviews, the bathroom is almost as big as the bedroom... which is really great. Spent a lot of time in the tub!On the second day of our stay, the room next to us started sounding like a night club... around 4pm! After a quick peek, we realized it was a group of kids for Prom. Rather than deal with them later in the night we called downstairs and were moved immediately to the 26th floor. The room was slightly smaller, but definitely quiet! The staff was VERY helpful in our transition to rooms and the entire ordeal was over within a matter of minutes.The Grand Hyatt is very conveniently located to shopping, restaurants and the waterfront. We rented a car from Enterprise, which is only 4 or 5 blocks from the hotel.

It is next to the convention center, and a block from a major public transit hub (which connects to the airport as well as other areas.)The rooms are large, clean, and luxurious. The bathroom is larger than a double hotel room I stayed in in Denmark, and has a large soaking tub as well as a comfortable shower stall. The only oddity is that the sink seems to either produce warm water or cool water randomly, with little relationship to which tap I turn.The bed is comfortable, and the desk is spacious. There are power outlets in ask the places you'd want them. The wifi seems stable and reasonably fast.The staff have been helpful and pleasant.

We checked in with Amber at the front desk, she was very friendly and helpful, even giving us a complimentary room upgrade. This hotel is located in the heart of the shopping district, with Nordstrom Store No1 a block away and Pacific Place across the street.The Good:Awesome Location for business and shopping.Nicely sized and updated roomsVery friendly staff and excellent service.The Bad: The four valet's, who were not busy didn't offer to help us with our bags while we unloaded from the taxi. The TV is a big, nice brand new HD LG flat LED. The signal strength to the tv is so weak that the screen was incredibly dim and hard to see. The hotel does not have HD service. I don't mean to sound petty, but on a weekend away from the kids it is nice for my wife and I to come back and relax and watch a game. I played with settings and could not get it fixed.Overall, I would happily stay here again. It is consistently a great value for such a nice hotel in a premium location.

Surprise - the gentleman at the front desk moved rooms around and checked us in! We were staying on my husband's business points for 4 days. Hyatt knows how to treat it's points customers right unlike that other big H chain where we find ourselves in the worst rooms they have. This was an 18th floor room with a view towards the space needle. We had a room with 2 full beds but it worked as our 21 year old daughter was with us. We did place a towel in front of the door one night as some hallway noise was coming under the door but it seemed to be related to all the Baseball Fans staying at the hotel and arriving back at once.The bathroom had great amenities, a soaking tub and a spotless glass shower. The safe in the closet accomodated the laptop computer and we had plenty of hangers. The dresser was a little small since it accomodates the mini-bar. Right after check in someone knocked and asked if we had everythng we needed and she was very friendly.The doormen were knowledgeable and gave us good directions and information on the area. The Starbucks just outside the lobby was slow as molasses but friendly just not efficient! The Grayline bus to the airport leaves at 15 to and 15 after the hour from the west side of the hotel. This was a very good location as we went to ACT theater one night, walked over and back to Pikes Place Market another and to the Seattle Art Museum. Several malls are also close by with Food Courts."},{"0":"Billings","1":"47.61276","2":"-122.3333","3":"Grand Hyatt Seattle","4":"5","5":"Grand Hyatt Seattle staff is highly trained and provide excellent service in all areas during your stay at the hotel.

I was in town for a marathon the city was hosting. I arrived a few days early so that I could tour the city as well as rest a bit. As with any walking friendly city, location is so important. Trust me, It was centrally located. In one day, I walked to the CenturyLink Field event center for the expo, visited the market, the needle, and hopped aboard a ferry. Upon my return, I had the choice of a relaxing bath in a spacious tub or a quick shower. Definitely after the marathon, that tub came in handy!!! I was able to sleep comfortably every night which was very important for my mindset. Every evening I would return to a clean room with everything I had requested. Housekeeping was very attentive. Also, there's a Starbucks inside the hotel as well as a place that makes hot sandwiches which came in very handy for my last minute carb fix. If ever in Seattle again, I'm staying here!!Thank you for your comments. We're so happy that you enjoyed your stay and were able to take advantage of all the amenities to prep and decompress from your marathon. It's wonderful that you were also able to explore the city and even get on the water while you were here!

Had a morning flight in and got to the hotel by 12 PM. They had my room ready and they were able to accommodate my request to be on the same floor as my brother's room. The room itself was just right for a family of four and the bathroom was a very nice size to accommodate the girl's toiletries and the boy's minimal essentials. Bathroom had tub separate from a nice size shower stall. As for the hotel location, only a block away from Pacific Place mall which had restaurants and a movie theater. The hotel was also only 7 blocks away from Pike Place Market which we practically went to every day. Very convenient to public transportation to and from airport as well as to the Space Needle.

Great location for everything. Staff were overall great and helped us with a broken handle on our luggage. The only issue I have is why hotels in general only provide towels for two guests in a room that sleeps four We had asked for early booking, but the room was not ready. After a long flight I chose to wait in the lobby and it was awfully cold. My husband and son had left to attend a baseball game. When I got to the room after a two-hour wait, I then had to call down to get extra towels, as I knew there were not enough for all of us. We had a view of the space needle which was great. We were very pleased to find the mini-bar was empty and we could stock up the fridge with refreshments. At over 350.00/night with all the fees/taxes, it was pricey. There was a caf accessible from the hotel and we made a lot of use of it for a quick breakfast before heading out to see the sights. Overall it was really good, but expensive."},{"0":"Salt Lake City","1":"47.61276","2":"-122.3333","3":"Grand Hyatt Seattle","4":"4","5":"I am not Hyatt elite and I was reluctant to book this location. I opted for a suite and Kendal hooked me up with an amazing view for the week. Electronic blinds are nice, bathroom spacious, shower walk in. Beds are old - Marriott and Westin have better beds without question. Televisions stink (outdated and small). Exercise room is significantly better than average. I could not talk the front desk into experiencing the concierge lounge for less than 50. Not drinking, I could not justify that cost. Housekeeping was excellent, I requested turn down. I did learn to request sheet changed daily - 3 day sheet changes is too much for me. Bell desk was prompt, friendly. They offered to take my bags up at arrival and I accepted - missed a tip when they forgot about me.

When I was hotel shopping I saw that the Grand Hyatt's rates were identical to many others in the area, so I decided to jump in with them. After I booked, it gave me an option to try to upgrade to a suite for 39, so, I said What the hell! and went for it.After, arriving in Seattle and taking the rail line to downtown, I emerged and walked 2 blocks to the Grand Hyatt. The lobby was quiet, intimate and spacious. Cassie welcomed me and began to check me in. She confirmed she upgraded me to the Emerald suite and told me I really gotten a good deal! I hope so, I though to my self. I ended up on the top floor with an amazing view of the sound, as well as much of downtown.The suite was awesome. It is hard to describe such an amazing room, with the view and all. It just sort of takes your breath away for a minute and you just soak it all in. None of the pictures here do this property justice. If you like what you see, you will be even more impressed when you are there. The suite did not even look like a hotel room, but rather some nice apartment I only wish I could afford. There were plenty of knick knacks, art, books, etc, all over. The Grand bed was - well, grand! You almost never want to get out of it. The linens were amazing, the bath stocked with every essential. Even a separate bath gel in case a bubble bath was in order (which it was one night). With more than enough room for two, several additional people could easily fit it with out any problems. Everything was neat, clean, comfortable, and housekeeping did an amazing job each day!The real gem of the hotel with Grand Club on 27. Although, not a lot of snacks, there were free sodas and juice all throughout the day. Tom, our host in the evening is the jewel holding the crown together! Beyond friendly, fun, and always on top of everything, he genuinely seemed to care! He remembered several guests drink choices from night to night (He certainly remembered mine, and I saw him acknowledge and recognize others). This level of personal attention is what sets this place apart from the rest.Watching the game on TV in the lounge, sipping a cocktail and munching on some cheese and veggies, I was quite happy. Tom seemed able to converse with kids and adults alike. Making his guests smile and happy seems to come naturally for him. Also a wealth of information on places to go, and the best way to get there, it was like having a live Google to chat with!The location of this hotel means that you really do not need a car. You can walk just about any where or a short cab ride at most. Save your money - forgo the car (and parking) and enjoy this city. There is a Starbucks and Deli in the lobby and several other Starbucks within a few blocks, so access to coffee and food are not a worry. Plenty of shopping and all the great attractions (Pike Place, Space Needle, etc) nearby!I would certainly stay here again - even if it cost a little bit more! Pamper yourself - relax and enjoy Seattle from the Grand Hyatt - it will be a a Grand Memory for sure!I appreciate you taking the time to give feedback on all the aspects of your stay with us at the Grand Hyatt Seattle. I am thrilled to hear that you chose us to spend your Fourth of July holiday with and that you were able to experience all that our hotel has to offer. Our suites are spacious and equipped with everything you need so I was glad to hear how comfortable you were. As well, I will certainly pass along the compliments to Cassie and Tom - they are truly a valuable part of our team. We look forward to welcoming you back to our hotel!Lindye W.

The valet was very quick with the car which is always fantastic. My only pet peeve is that there are a Starbucks and small shop attached to the property, but they do not take room charges.

The light rail goes from the airport to west lake station, just 2 blocks from the hotel. Given Seattle's terrible highway traffic, having a hotel that can be easily reached for a fee of 3.00 on the light rail is a huge plus. The hotel is within easy walking distance of all of the tourist sites, museums, cruise ship and ferry docks, as well as many bars and restaurants. If you are planning on spending all of your time in downtown, you will not need a car if you stay here. If you decide to venture out of the city, there is a Hertz car rental office located in the hotel parking garage. The hotel itself is very nice. The rooms are spacious, clean, and modern. The staff is very helpful and eager to make sure that your stay is stress free. If it happens to be raining, be sure to ask the front desk for an umbrella. They provide complementary sturdy and large umbrellas for guest use. We asked for a room with a view of the water. We had a room on the 25th floor that looked straight down Pine street to the famous Public Market sign. The view of Puget Sound was fantastic. I highly recommend this hotel."},{"0":"Melbourne","1":"47.61276","2":"-122.3333","3":"Grand Hyatt Seattle","4":"5","5":"We stayed here for six nights and absolutely loved this hotel.

The hotel itself is ideally situated in the heart of town, just a short walk to Pikes Market and very close to shops and cinemas. We also found the staff very friendly and polite. We dined at the steakhouse and although we were not expecting it, it was fine dining and of course reasonably expensive, but definitely worth it. The steaks were divine! If I came back to Seattle again, I would definitely stay here. We loved it! The only small drawback that we didn't notice until one of our last days was that there was construction across the street. Luckily it didn't keep us awake. All in all I would definitely recommend staying here."},{"0":"Vancouver","1":"47.61276","2":"-122.3333","3":"Grand Hyatt Seattle","4":"4","5":"We were accommodated last minute on the same night that we arrived in Seattle for an emergency visit and it was a great choice in hotel due to the beautiful rooms and convenient location. The main complaint we had and reason why we'd also reconsider this hotel is the number of disruptions during the night. We were on the 27th floor this time and the stay before that, the 28th and the breakfast club had a toasted fire BOTH times! It was very inconvenient to woken up at 7am and have to run down 28 flights of stairs twice. It was a tough weekend due to the purpose of the visit and after a long day and night that was quite a disappointing situation.It would have been nice to be informed that it was taken care of, but we found that out after 20 minutes of waiting outside the hotel for 20-30 minutes each time thinking it was an emergency evacuation"},{"0":"Hayward","1":"47.61276","2":"-122.3333","3":"Grand Hyatt Seattle","4":"4","5":"Hotel felt very mellow, We hardly saw anyone in the hotel. Ruths Chris has a good happy hour,cheap drinks and apps .We checked in Saturday and were given a room on the 20th floor. Room was nice and modern. Bed was comfortable, roon had what we needed. Room rate of 143 and tax was 22 a day kind of nuts but oh well. This hotel is in a great locatio...close to everything Pikes Place Market, light rail station, monorail, bars with happy hour. Theight rail station to airport is only two blocks up. We also relaxed in the hot tub which was relaxing. Overall good stay , not crowded, great location, and nice rooms."},{"0":"Tokyo","1":"47.61276","2":"-122.3333","3":"Grand Hyatt Seattle","4":"5","5":"Great location and close to pretty much everything.What can you say really Room was great, spacious clean and well stocked, Bed was ultra comfortable and bathroom towels and amenities were all spot on. Only complaint could be that the T.V was very small compared to the standard of the room.Staff were great and always on point.I used the Hyatt Gym everyday and found it to be immaculate and never tooo busy.Only bummer was to pay for internet but at check out the lady asked if I wanted to join up to the Hyatt gold scheme and I did and then the internet was free but unless I had done that the internet was not free which considering the normal rate of the rooms is a little bit much in my opinion. On the subject of cost, I was on a discounted room rate but if I did take the going rate....all I can say is that if you want quality like this....expect to pay for it.Me and my girlfriend enjoyed and were comfortable every minute we were in the hotel.Thank you so much for your review. We're so glad that you enjoyed your stay with us. Your comfort and happiness are our main priorities and it's wonderful that the amenities, location and features of the room made your stay a good one.

The staff were pleasant, very helpful and upbeat. It's a great location right in the center of many historical sights! It's walking distance to sights like Penn's Landing, the Liberty Bell and Independence Hall. The hotel is across from the US Mint, next to Ben Franklin's grave and near some good eateries like Sonny's and Happily Ever After. It also offers its own restaurant, bar and fitness center. Free wifi. It was a reasonable rate for the area. Parking was 36.75 for overnight but you can keep your car there the next day until 5pm. However you may be able to find a cheaper garage nearby. As far as the rooms themselves go- those I would rate a little lower. The room was a little on the small side and definitely could have been cleaner (like the bathroom and under the beds) but it was adequate and by no means did I feel like it was so dirty I wouldn't stay the night. Rooms are probably a 3 however. The room did have a coffee maker, microwave and mini refrigerator which was great! They are updating some different features so maybe this was part of it. Dear Trip Advisor Guest,Thank you for your feedback. I'm glad you enjoyed your stay and I would agree that we are in the perfect location to visit many of the historical sites in the area. It's a great part of town. Thank you again and we hope to see you back sometime in the near future.

Also the front desk agent ain't even try to ask me would i still like the employee discount added in which if I was a front desk agent I would still asked the guest if she still wanted to add the discount.Dear Trip Advisor Traveler, Thank you for the review.

Sometimes I pick obscure places to stay on vacation...but our 2 teens have declared that I have redeemed myself with this hotel pick! Everything here is new, fresh, modern, and clean. Huge rooms. Huge living area with sofa bed, desk, chairs, TV huge bedroom with 2 queens, TV, bench huge bathroom, etc. The absolute best part is the breakfast and dinner/cocktail hour. Breakfast is a real buffet with sausage, scrambled eggs, potatoes, biscuits, waffles, pastries, etc. Even more surprising, the cocktail/snack hour really is a light dinner buffet. They have a salad bar, baked potato bar, a pasta dish, chicken strips, hot dogs, soup, nachos, chips/salsa, etc. We decided to just make a meal of it the night we arrived. Great for kids. You are able to get 3 drinks/person each evening: 4 kinds of wine, Bud Light on tap, margaritas, and several cocktails/mixed drinks. They also have coffee and a soda fountain. The lobby has a refreshment station with popcorn, a soda fountain, and 24/7 coffee. The hotel is a couple block walk to the SuperDome, and a reasonable 10 minute (safe) walk down Poydros to the riverfront, including the big Hilton, Harrah's, and the outlet mall. From there, it's a few blocks East to Jackson Sqaure/Cafe du Monde, etc. The cross street here becomes Bourbon St. When it crosses Canal St. (The official divider between the French Quarter and the CBD), so you're really right in the heart of the action in a 10 min walk that direction also. Great location all around! They valet park everything, but have a massive motor court where they can pull around 15+ cars at a time, so no problem there. We will definitely choose this hotel for our next visit to the Big Easy!"},{"0":"Birmingham","1":"29.94926","2":"-90.07236","3":"Drury Inn & Suites New Orleans","4":"1","5":"I have stayed at this Drury Inn every other year when I visit New Orleans during Mardi Gras Season. This year was no different... To make a long story short- Drury Inn charged me for two rooms but failed to let me know that upon arrival or checking in the hotel (I had apreviously called the hotel to cancel the reservation FYI). After I noticed the charge on my account I called and spoke with the manager Patrick to reverse the charges. He was super rude, loud talking over me, and had an I dont care attitude. He stated that he would fax in the necessary paperwork to my bank as they requested via email.( that was a Sunday) Monday went and still no funds-Tuesday came and still no funds. At this point my automatic withdrawals started to come out of the account. Which enabled my account to go in the negative and it set a domino effect. I checked in on Saturday and my bank froze my account due to suspicious fraud so I wasnt able to get any money off my account (but it didnt matter because Drury Inn had it all wrap up). Tuesday before I left I spoke with my bank and they told me they never received the proper paperwork so I went to the front desk and spoke with Jaime and she faxed the proper info over for me. Not even 30 minutes later my bank called me and said they received the paperwork and the funds are credited to my account. Now on to the housekeeping- our room had not been cleaned the entire time we were there- which was a Saturday through a Tuesday. Yes the trash was emptied and the beds covers had been pulled over( which I had an issue with because the first day the sheets I had had urine stains on them) after I returned back to the room I asked if someone could come change my sheets. When I returned I asked the front desk if it was taken care of and they stated yes (what they didnt know is that I put a quarter in the middle of the bed under the covers). When I came to the room it was still there. The entire I was there no one vacuum the floor and I had to call everyday to ask for towels - the minimum required towels was not left in my room after cleaning it. I had a few questions and concerns for the manager Patrickbut he blew me off, loud talking me, his exact words were you did this so deal with it. Tuesday morning I attempt email to contact the manager Slade about the situation just to let him know that my bank stated they never received the authorization to reverse funds but he never called me back and I called him at 8:22 am. Yes I went down to the front desk and Jaime took care of it but he was avoiding me because he did not want to handle the situation. His exact words were you would have to call Patrick because he knows the situation and I dont have anything to do with it since he already knows the story. The crazy thing is I actually love this hotel but I wont ever be staying here again when I come to New Orleans. Talk about unprofessional and unable to handle a situation! By the way if I could give a negative 22 on the score I would. All weekend I was suppose to be enjoying the festivities for my birthday but I had to continuously run up behind Drury Inn for answers. What if I didnt have any cash on me how was I going to be able to get back home Im so disgusted by it ALL."},{"0":"Birmingham","1":"29.94926","2":"-90.07236","3":"Drury Inn & Suites New Orleans","4":"5","5":"This is one of the best hotels I have ever stayed in! Check-in was a breeze and had no problems getting to our room. The lobby displayed a classic 1920s hotel style, as well as a grand staircase. The hotel's elevators are room key activated only, for safety reasons. We had a smoking corner room on the ninth floor and there was no trace of smoke anywhere in the room. There was clean white sheets on the bed and clean carpets. Also to our surprise, there was a door that led out to a balcony (we was one of the two rooms to have this.), which I enjoyed being a outdoors person. The bathroom was clean and spotless. The shower provided shampoo, conditioner, and body wash, although I brought my own. The 5:30 Kickback in the lobby was like dinner to us. There was hot dogs, chicken tenders, cocktails, and liquor (2 for every person and show your room key). The pool and hot tub were clean and pristine, although I didn't use it. The views from the rooftop were breathtaking. The fitness room had a bike and step machines and two treadmills (a somewhat small room, though). The general manager and his staff were great to us. I will recommend this Drury Hotel and will stay here again when I come back to NOLA."},{"0":"Corpus Christi","1":"29.94926","2":"-90.07236","3":"Drury Inn & Suites New Orleans","4":"5","5":"We just returned from a three night stay at this hotel. We loved it. Public transportation is right out the front door (bus and streetcar). If you'd rather walk, just head strait down Carondelet - it turns into Bourbon when you cross Canal (6 blocks).Hot breakfast is provided every morning in the lobby. On Sun-Thur, each adult guest receives three complimentary evening cocktails in the lobby.The rooftop pool is small, as is the fitness center.The lobby is beautiful, with marble floors and nice chandeliers. We stayed in a king suite, and it had tons of space, although the bathroom area seemed small. Our teenaged nephew slept on the pull-out sofa, and appreciated all the room he had to spread out. He also appreciated that we had our own tv in the bedroom, so he could have control over the one in the living room. He loved the free internet access, but didn't love the TONS of pop-up ads that came along with it.The king suite had:One bedroom with king bed, two night stands with lamps, entertainment center with television, telephone, and closet. Living area with pull-out sofa, chair, recliner, coffee table, entertainment center with television, refrigerator, and microwave (2 free soft drinks and microwave popcorn provided), and desk area with internet access.The vanity area had another closet, as well as a coffee maker. Parking is 13 a day, which is a bargain. The lot is self-park, no valet, so you have access to your car whenever you need it.Make sure your room key is always handy. You need it to get in and out of the parking area, to use the elevators, and to get into the back entrance (all day) or the lobby entrance (after hours).This was our third trip to New Orleans, and our first stay at the Drury. I think we'll stay here again."},{"0":"Methuen","1":"29.94926","2":"-90.07236","3":"Drury Inn & Suites New Orleans","4":"5","5":"Hotel is great and will stay here again!

We normally stay at another chain of hotels but our normal arrangements were booked full. This is our first time at this particular hotel and staying with this chain. The positives are this hotel is nice, very updated, we found our 2 bedroom suite to be very spacious, very clean, and the offerings for the food choices of the happy hour and breakfast exceeded our expectations. The front desk staff were very kind and helpful. They even assisted me to book needed activities for our family. The negatives are this establishment is ran so tightly it is at the expense of the comfort of its customers. The happy hour requires you to keep up with a card per adult to ensure you receive no more than 3 beverages. The happy hour offerings are of course well drinks and cheap wine. My husband accidentally spilled his last glass of wine at the bar and the employee made mention he was exceeding the allowable amount of beverage as he begrudgingly replaced it. The air conditioner is fixed to not go below 70 F. Our entire family was extremely uncomfortable and sweated all night. The tubs are fixed to only allow showers. There are not individual toiletries. Instead there is a shampoo/conditioner/body wash dispenser attached to the wall. It kind of grossed me out to think every other naked person before had touched it during their shower. They do advertise to earn so many reward points for everyday you do not utilize housekeeping so that leads me to believe this is a brand/chain initiative. It's a nice hotel that is uncomfortable and that's just unfortunate. My husband's review was, It's like being a guest of a cheapskate."},{"0":"Denver","1":"29.94926","2":"-90.07236","3":"Drury Inn & Suites New Orleans","4":"4","5":"Comfortable rooms, although those on the street side pick up traffic noise.

The staff was very pleasant and competent and the facility was very clean. The breakfast buffet was pretty good (considering the price) and the dining room was 4x bigger than you would typically see in a free breakfast area. The afternoon Happy Hour was always fun. We saw a lot of New Orleans from there, with the exception of the Garden District. Very good stay and I would go back there on my next visit to NOLA. The rates were fairly good, but the parking seemed excessive."},{"0":"London","1":"29.94926","2":"-90.07236","3":"Drury Inn & Suites New Orleans","4":"5","5":"Stayed in the Drury Inn and Suite for 2 nights over memorial day weekend and it was the best hotel i've stayed in for a long time. Our suite was huge with a large lounge, bathroom and huge floor to ceiling arced window which over looked the pool.The reception staff were always friendly and ready to help with suggestions of places to eat and really added a little extra to the stay. We were also allowed to check in at 11am without any additional cost which was really appreciated.The happy hour had a huge range and gave us the energy we needed after a day of walking NOLA's famous streets before heading out for dinner. Breakfast was also very good, with lots on offer and staff were always available to top up anything running empty.The location is great - with a street car stop right outside, altho we walked to and from the hotel to the french quartered repeatedly as it was a nice walk and only a few blocks.The rooftop pool and hot tub were perfect and always clean - the only problem was they only open them at 9am!Have only good things to say of this hotel - would book again in a second and would recommend to anyone visiting NOLA - it's a fantastic place!"},{"0":"North Tonawanda","1":"29.94926","2":"-90.07236","3":"Drury Inn & Suites New Orleans","4":"5","5":"My husband and I stayed here for three nights last weekend and loved it from the moment we walked into the lobby.

They gave us several recommendations for restaurants nearby. The hotel is very elegant and so immaculate! Location is wonderful...close to the french quarter but in a quiet, safe area.

The whole experience from arrival to departure was enjoyable. We arrived at the hotel before lunchtime, and were pleasantly surprised to be able to go straight up to our room. The young woman who checked us in (Jamie) was so welcoming and friendly, we felt at home instantly. She even gave us a great recommendation for lunch, which we took, and enjoyed. Our room was on the 6th floor. It was large and well set out. We had 2 comfortable double beds , an armchair, desk, large screen TV, fridge, coffee maker and toiletries. The included breakfast was plentiful. Not a huge choice, but we always found something we enjoyed. It was busy during our stay so some mornings it was hard to find anywhere to sit, but one thing I will mention is the manager(s) were always making sure tables were cleaned briskly, so the wait was never too long. I found seeing management level doing this task and mingling with the people staying at the hotel a really nice touch. They always made time to ask about your day, and seemed to genuinely be interested in what you had to say. The nightly 'kickback' was another nice touch. We usually just had a nibble on the chips or popcorn,as had already eaten enough during the day, but it was fun to meet fellow holiday makers and hear about where they were from, or ideas of what to do around New Orleans. All in all I can not fault this hotel at all. Well done Drury Inn New Orleans for a efficiently run hotel with welcoming and friendly staff. Keep up the great work."},{"0":"Amelia","1":"29.94926","2":"-90.07236","3":"Drury Inn & Suites New Orleans","4":"4","5":"The Drury Inn and Suites in the Central Business District, New Orleans is close to everything, a few minutes walk you are in the French Quarter or at the Superdome.

Located in a quiet area 5 blocks west of Canal and Bourbon streets. Free all you can eat hot breakfast in the morning. Hors d'oeuvres served in the evening along with 3 free alcoholic drinks per person. However, if you do this, you lose the chance to sample all the great New Orleans restaurants. g But, if you are on a tight budget, this really helps to defray expenses.Trolley line is just across the street from the front door and it will get you to just about everywhere in the area.King size bed was comfortable with 5 pillows provided. Our room had a whirlpool bath. Front desk clerks are so pleasant and always smiling considering they seem to spend most of their time answering tourist questions.

We arrived around 4:30 in the afternoon. Check in was quick and the clerk was extremely friendly and helpful. I requested the highest floor and away from street traffic and both were granted. The hotel is really nice inside and was spotless. Our room was a double and it was extremely clean and roomy. The bathroom was really nice and the beds were comfortable. We had adequate towels for the two of us. Another plus for this hotel is the secured parking lot is adjacent to the building. I really don't think there was anything that I would say needed improvement there. Customer service was great throughout the stay. You have to use your roomkey to access the hotel after 10:00 PM. You also have to use the key to operate the elevators from the lobby and to open and close the gate so be sure to keep one of your room keys when you check out if you are driving or you will have to go back inside as I did to get a key to get your car out. The hotel is walking distance to Bourbon St and the Riverwalk area (In my opinion). It may be a little far if you have any mobility issues. It is only a 4 or 5 block walk to the Superdome or the New Orleans Arena.

We were looking for a nice place that was near major tourist attractions and didn't cost a lot - as we were just passing through on the way to our vacation. This Drury worked out nicely.It was easy to find from I-10 - near the SuperDome and close enough to French Quarter that we could walk - even in the heat of July. Having said that, I did have the impression that it was closer. We walked to Canal St and the Riverwalk - several blocks and then worked our way back through a couple of FQ streets to find a spot for dinner. It was a LOT of walking. After dinner, we caught a cab (for less than 10) back to the hotel. We spent the evening in the rooftop pool. It was fairly small, but adequate. Our room had beautiful tall windows and ceilings, making quite a first impression. The beds were comfortable. The parking lot side of the building was rather loud because of the frequent passing by of the streetcar (this streetcar went to the Garden District, I think). Parking was 15 - a bargain compared to most of the hotels I looked at, and it was self park. You needed your room key to get in/out of the lot, but could come and go as you please. Much easier than valet, in my opinion.Breakfast was nothing special. We found the area crowded and the selection very limited. We ate a small bite and stopped at Cafe du Monde for beignets later in the morning. We would stay here again under the same circumstances, but if you are planning a longer stay or want a hotel with more of a NO feel, Le Pavillion is right across the street and is beautiful. Hotel Monteleone was a little closer to things and was the most beautiful hotel I saw.

When we reserved we requested a small refrigerator with a freezer unit (to re-freeze cooler pack for my husband's insulin) it was present when we arrived, but not freezing properly -- it was fixed promptly and worked fine the rest of our stay. The breakfast buffet was much nicer than average and includes do-it-yourself waffles. (Make sure to get to the breakfast within the stated hours -- they are serious about shutting down on time.) The free drink and snack time each evening was a nice perk, though we were only present for it once -- too many other things to do in the area! The rooftop pool and hot tub looked great, but the weather was a little too cool to make use of them while we were there -- go up for the area view even if you don't want to have a soak."},{"0":"Albuquerque","1":"29.94926","2":"-90.07236","3":"Drury Inn & Suites New Orleans","4":"5","5":"My husband and I stayed at this hotel the weekend before Mardi Gras. I was a bit apprehensive because of some reviews but overall I was pleased. The staff was very nice and helpful. We left our room early in the morning and several days near noon and upon our return our room was nice and tidy. We had a jacuzzi suite and it was quite spacious...enough room for much more than two people. There are two full size closets, mini fridge, flat panel TV, livingroom, and separate bedroom. The short walk to the French Quarter was nice and there is a Domino's just around the corner for an evening snack...or there are many nicer places that deliver to the hotel. Maybe the only little thing that kind of bothered us was the view. I am not sure if all jacuzzie suites are situated in the back corner of the hotel but our view was faced west and consisted primarily of two brick walls bordering the parking lot and some buildings off in the distance. Since we didn't spend much time in our room, the view did not bother us much. It was our first trip to New Orleans for some of the Mardi Gras festivities and we look forward to staying here again in the future."},{"0":"Jackson","1":"29.94926","2":"-90.07236","3":"Drury Inn & Suites New Orleans","4":"5","5":"My husband and I stayed here during Jazz Fest in early May. The hotel isn't much to look at from the outside- it appears to be an older building. We had a king room on the 7th floor- the view was of a parking lot with graffiti on the walls. The room was perfectly adequate though- the bed was comfy, shower pressure good, and we didn't hear any noise from outside or within the hotel. Nice and quiet- we slept great. The 5:30 kickback was great! Free drinks and appetizers. I just wish it lasted more than an hour since we didn't make it back to the hotel in time each night for it. The breakfast was fresh and plentiful as well. Waffle maker, hot buffet items, juices, etc. And included in the cost of the hotel room- a great plus. The hotel was a short walk from French quarter and other areas of interest. The city bus ran close by to the hotel- we took this to the City Park and rode bikes, as well as to the Jazz Fest. The price for our room was pretty steep since it was during Jazz Fest- but we still felt like it was a good value and in line with other hotels in the area. Parking was 25 a night plus tax. The hotel is still undergoing renovations- it looks like the parking garage will be attached to the building rather than 10 minutes away which will be nice. Overall would recommend staying here- no reservations!"},{"0":"New York City","1":"29.94926","2":"-90.07236","3":"Drury Inn & Suites New Orleans","4":"5","5":"My family of 5 stayed here for two nights.

It was a very nice hotel, helpful pleasant staff, spacious rooms, and we LOVED the free drinks, and kickback! We stayed out to late and so we missed breakfast, but everything else was very nice! We did have a small complaint that our room smelled like smoke it didn't really bother us that much, but we didn't want to get charged for smoking in the room when we didn't, so we reported it. The guy at the front desk said he would have someone right up to deodorize it and credited us for our parking fee for the inconvenience. That was SO nice! By the time we got back to the room, we couldn't smell the smoke anymore and it was a fresh scent in the room. I will stay here again!"},{"0":"Clarkesville","1":"29.94926","2":"-90.07236","3":"Drury Inn & Suites New Orleans","4":"5","5":"We had taken a road trip to Texas, and decided on our return drive to stay 3 nights in New Orleans, as I'd never visited this city. We definitely recommend Drury Inn Suites, located in the business district. Its close to everything the trolley tour buses have the Drury as one of its stops. Our king suite was all that we wanted more! The bed was comfortable roomy bathroom was a welcome sight. Also enjoyed the morning's hot breakfast the evening food with beverages.

We love the concept of the kickback and not having to get out and find a place for dinner when youre already tired from sightseeing. Kickback always has enough different items to satisfy the hungry in most people.

No noise comfortable room. The roof top pool was OK temperature for a night swim, even though it was cold outside. Jacuzzi was hot. Small exercize room. On major bus lines but it was quicker to walk to French Quarter and Riverwalk. The breakfast and afternoon kickback were good. Three well drinks p/p at happy hour made me happy. The entire hotel was very clean, well maintained and in a safe neighborhood. And by the way, we took the public bus from the airport for 2. It is called Jefferson transit,leaves every half hour, you can take two pieces of luggage, it took 1/2 hour to arrive three blocks from the hotel."},{"0":"East Orange","1":"29.94926","2":"-90.07236","3":"Drury Inn & Suites New Orleans","4":"5","5":"Drury Inn and Suites in New Orleans was a wonderful choice for our extended stay after a conference.

We did not have a great view from our window but most of the time we were out and about. The price of the hotel was just right. The breakfast was free and plentiful. The best part about Drury Inn was the Kickback hours--free hot food and drinks! Every staff member we encountered was friendly and went out of their way to accommodate their guests.

The staff and facilities are top notch. We booked two king suites for six guests pre-cruise and loved our rooms. However, until the valet area is complete, we may have to look elsewhere. We were trying to assist our elderly parents, our two children, and lots of luggage and feel the unloading area being used is very unsafe during peak times. There just isn't enough room to handle the volume of traffic. This was a very stressful situation before we even checked in. I am still rating our stay with 5 stars because the staff deserves it.

I walked from my hotel to both of these locations for a week. This hotel is clean, nostalgic, and accommodating. We received free drink cards upon check-in for drinks in the lobby from 530P to 7P. Although there are no restaurants in this hotel, they can get delivery of almost anything you can think of as far as food. The first night I was there, I was leary of walking to a nearby restaurant or Bourbon Street, but there was no need to be. This hotel is growing and has a brand new wing that will open in about 6-12 months. The construction commenced M-F starting at 7A, but no contruction on the weekends!

The furniture was up-to date. The beds were comfortable. The free breakfast buffet in the morning was wonderful...everything you need to start the day off right and the free supper buffet in the evening was equally delicious, including 3 alcoholic beverages per person. The rooftop pool and hot tub area with lounging chairs etc. was also very clean. The staff were also very friendly and polite. From check-in to checkout all the employees were great. Any request was responded to immediately.

The first was before Hurricane Katrina and the 2nd was after in 2010. We remembered having a very nice stay there before so decided to try this hotel again. The location is wonderful...right next to the trolley line (but not a noice issue...very quite). The price is very reasonable. We checked around...an excellent value in my opinion. We got a 2 room King Suite for the 3 of us. We loved everything about this room. The ceilings and windows are old-style tall...which just feels right in this city. There is lots of granite everywhere. The living room is a completely separate room so everyone had their privacy. The king bed was very comfortable. My 17 year old son said the fold out couch was pretty nice too....although he wouldn't want to share it with anyone...then again, he's 6'4 and about 210 lbs.! The breakfast was a very nice buffet, hot, and plentiful with real scrambled eggs, biscuits, bacon, fruit, juice...and the evening cocktails/soda and wings, chips, baked potatoes, hotdogs, veggies, dips, chicken fingers were plentiful and a great alternative to eating out again. We had a big lunch so just snack food was perfect allowing us time to enjoy the pool on the ROOF!! Parking is fenced, selfpark right next to the hotel for about 17. It is within easy walking distance of the famous Mother's...and all the traditional New Orleans favorites. When you consider the price of breakfast and the free alcoholic beverages and snacks...it is so worth the price....I think with parking included we paid about 150 tops. I am ready to go there again!"},{"0":"Kansas City","1":"29.94926","2":"-90.07236","3":"Drury Inn & Suites New Orleans","4":"5","5":"This is not your typical Drury inn! This is no cookie cutter hotel.

The hotel is within walking distance of the French Quarter if you want a small hike, but we did drive and park. There are closer hotels.They offer 3 complimentary drinks per night for guests and the free breakfast is very good.All this at a very attractive rate.

Our room was very clean, bigger than I expected (just a standard room) and the bathroom had a marble look. The in-room fridge microwave was awesome. We utilized the pool every day and it was very quiet and refreshing. The fitness room contained 2 treadmills 1 bike and a flat screen tv. No weights, but at least there was a place to run off some fun from the night before! The location was a few short blocks to anything and everything! We always opted for the main streets, and never felt scared on any of our walks around town (even at 2am). We will stay here again the next time we visit for sure!

The location was very convenient. The French Quarter was a short walk and the area was very safe. Close to the trolley and the WWII Museum. The suite was large, but the bedroom had no window and the window in the other room had no view. The sofa bed did not pull out easily, so my son just slept on the sofa which he was ok with. It was nice having the extra space privacy with 2 rooms and the price was right. The complimentary breakfast was nice. We didn't make much use of the evening social hour because who wants to eat hot dogs chips when there is such great food in New Orleans, but if you are a family economizing you could easily make a meal out of it.

The hotel is next to a trolley car stop which is nice. FYI if you have never been to the city buy an all day pass for the trolley. Its 3 per person for all day on and off stops. best deal around. It includes the buses in that pass as well. I have only two minor complaints and one is that the food during cocktail hour did not have healthy options for those that are watching their diet. The other was that we were next to the housekeeping closet and they were kindof loud early in the morning.

The staff here is awesome. The plus for us is, this hotel is located around 1 block of the parade route. Being at the end of the route also gives you the opportunity to score bags and bags stuff being slung off the floats. It's also so close that if you have to use the restroom, you have a clean private restroom right around the corner. If you don't mind the walk, this location is also only around half a mile from Burbon and French Quarter. There are other hotels near, but we enjoy this hotel enough that we would continue to lock down a room during this party.They also have a buffet breakfast, nothing fancy... eggs, sausage, waffles, fruit, cereal, grits, biscuit and gravy.

We had stayed at the Drury before and enjoyed it very much. This time was no different. The hotel is clean and comfortable with a large inviting lobby. The have adopted valet-only parking which at 25 is expensive, but in line with other hotels in the area. The valets were very helpful and the service was excellent. The hotel offers a complimentary evening happy hour and breakfast with rather good food. We had a corner room, which was not a suite, but very spacious with a whirlpool bath. The room was comfortable, quiet, and had a nice view. The Drury is located at the edge of the French Quarter and provides easy access to the major sites. We had the added benefit of being only 1 block from the race start line at Lafayette Square.

After visiting museums and shopping all day, we didn't want to go out to restaurant. The evening meal offered baked potatoes, grilled chicken, pasta, salad, hot dogs chili. We put together a nice meal without having to leave the hotel. Then the next morning, we had a complete breakfast before heading off to the Aquarium. All the staff were very professional helpful.

You are only four blocks from Canal Street, Bourbon Street and Royal Street or the streetcar stops right outside the hotel if you don't feel like walking. 3 for a 24 hour pass is a good deal and an easy way to move around all the key tourist areas. The Drury Inn offers excellent accommodation for the money: we had an oversized 2 room suite King Bed Non-Smoking suite for five nights which was clean, comfortable, well laid out. The Breakfast and Kick Back offerings should be seen as a bonus: it's quite naturally geared to US tastes and if you like what's on offer then enjoy (we did for the most part) if not then there are plenty of good eating spots within easy reach. As for the three alcoholic drinks each night what's to complain about Just be aware there are quite long lines on Friday and Saturday nights. Finally, many thanks to Kyle, Assistant General Manager, for the useful chats we had about New Orleans/ Memphis and Daniel always helpful and courteous in the dining room."},{"0":"Dallas","1":"29.94926","2":"-90.07236","3":"Drury Inn & Suites New Orleans","4":"5","5":"I recently stayed at the Drury Inn for 3 nights. I was assigned a corner room on the 6th fl that had two exposures of Poydras street. I was very satisfied with the room. It was quiet (some minor street noise), very well appointed, had a nice whirlpool type jet tub, and the TV channel selection was decent. The room was clean and well cared for. The hotel was very nice, had some character, and was close to most of what people want to see when visiting New Orleans. However, it was a few blocks from most of those attractions, which I didnt mind, but someone who wants to be in the thick of the action might find it disappointing being in the business district where the hotel is. The walk to the waterfront or Bourbon Street was about 6 blocks and felt safe even at night. The free food and drink was a big plus. The breakfast offerings met all my expectations. Well-cooked scrambled eggs, waffles, bagels, etc. The afternoon happy hour selection was weaker. The hot dogs were consistently under cooked and somewhat unattractive in appearance. I would say beef was either non-existent or way down on the ingredients listing. The other foods were satisfactory, but nothing off the charts. Hey, but this was all free, so I cant subtract points. But if you plan on feasting your physician will take exception with your meal choices. In a general sense, based on observations at various times during my midweek visit, this hotel tends to attract a somewhat older crowd.say vacationing retirees. I only saw 1 child during my 3 day visit and limited people in their 40s or less. My only real issue with the hotel was the fitness center. It literally consisted of 2 treadmills and a bike. Nothing else. If a hotel advertises offering such an amenity, I dont think such a limited offering qualifies. While there was a sign up suggesting an improved offering will be forthcoming when the new hotel wing is complete, that didnt help me on my visit and I only consider hotels that offer such because I plan on using them. I wasnt able to here.All in all, I was satisfied with my stay despite the fitness center misrepresentation. I would not hesitate to select the Drury on a future stay."},{"0":"Reno","1":"29.94926","2":"-90.07236","3":"Drury Inn & Suites New Orleans","4":"4","5":"The room are old but have modern conveniences.

We ended up in New Orleans and enjoyed touring many familiar and favorite neighborhoods. We made our way slowing down Magazine Street close to where we onced lived and realized that a St. Patrick's Day parade was wrapping up! Desperate to find accommodations my husband walked into the Drury Inn on Poydras St. and booked the last room of the hotel.The lobby was lively with happy hour and we enjoyed a quick glass of wine before going to our room on the first floor! We were amazed at the quality and comfort considering the low price we were offered! ( Ask for those military and senior discounts.) The staff was courteous and friendly, the room quiet and comfortable! The inn is close to the quarter and cost a mere 6 for a friendly cab ride! We were dropped off right at the start of the parade on Bourbon St and enjoyed a after-parade drink in another hotel on Canal. We were fortunate to meet the Grand Marshall's family and enjoy their story of life in and around New Orleans!

Though centrally located, It is a good walk from most areas. The trolley stops just a block away which is nice. Take a ride -- and see how close it comes to parked vehicles. Breakfast is always a treat, though Drury San Antonio had a wider variety of choices. And at 5:30pm it looked like guests actually dine on the wings, baked potatoes, hot dogs and the chili provided in lieu of heading out to dinner. Rouses, an attractive grocery, is nearby for quick fill-ins or paninis made to order or practically anything else food-related. The bed, in my opinion, was a bit soft as were the pillows. I wish they had queen-size beds too. The staff is very accommodating and willing to make suggestions for clubs, restaurants or attractions. The Drury is clean and modern and is currently building an addition which should provide more variety of rooms and maybe even a fancier breakfast. Oh, they even arranged for transportation from the airport."},{"0":"Ottawa","1":"29.94926","2":"-90.07236","3":"Drury Inn & Suites New Orleans","4":"5","5":"This was our first trip to New Orleans, so we had no experience with hotels in the city. We found the Drury Inn and Suites through reading reviews on TripAdvisor. The reviews were very helpful, and we are so glad that we stayed at the Drury. Our room was very nice, the bed comfortable and the air conditioning worked well. All the staff that we spoke to were very friendly and helpful. Wifi and breakfast are included in the price of the room as well as the 5:30 KIckback with three drinks per person and snacks. Another of the reasons that we chose this hotel based on the reviews on TripAdvisor was that the hotel is close enough to walk to the French Quarter and Canal Street, but far enough from the noise of Bourbon Street that you could actually get a good night's sleep. We were able to walk to the French Quarter for sightseeing and to the restaurants. The street cars to get to the Garden District or City Park are also within walking distance.We would definitely recommend the Drury Inn Suites to friends or family without hesitation and it would be our first choice as a hotel when we go back to New Orleans."},{"0":"Baton Rouge","1":"29.94926","2":"-90.07236","3":"Drury Inn & Suites New Orleans","4":"4","5":"I live within an hour of New Orleans, so I go often. I have stayed in many hotels. The Drury Inn became my go-to hotel. But it has been a while since I stayed overnight in NOLA. My last Drury review, the hotel was the greatest thing since man canned beer. But upgrades have knocked it down a notch. First the positives: it is about 4 blocks off of the French Quarter. So certainly close enough to walk in a couple minutes, but far enough away that it is quiet. You can actually sleep when you are ready. The breakfast is awesome with eggs, grits (real creamy grits), sausage, waffle makers, plus, plus. The 5pm kick back includes 3 free drinks and enough real food to count as dinner. While you have to eat at some NOLA restaurants to get the full NOLA experience, free breakfast and free dinner easily can save you 100 a day as a couple, making the trip more affordable. The rooms are updated, clean and comfortable.My only negative is the updates. They used to have free self parking. Now there is ONLY 28 a day for valet parking. Don't rent a car if you are flying in. The city is very walkable. But when you drive in like me, it really ups the cost. Then the convenience of the valet parking is negated by the very poor management of the process. You can not call down from your room to have your car pulled up front like any other hotel. You have to come down in person. For most of my stay there was only 1 guy around. He was fetching other cars and it took forever to get ours. Same thing when you return to the hotel. No one around, and you may wait 20-30 minutes to drop off your car. Frustrating to say the least. I would have MUCH, MUCH rather self parked.Thanks for your recent stay with us, and the kind words about the hotel and its offerings. Also, thanks for feedback on the parking. As you noted, we do only have valet parking now and it is at a fee. I was not aware of free parking in the past, but did some digging and found that in 2010, when construction on the addition began and during your last stay, free parking was offered. Also, please know that we do allow for call down for car retrieval as long as it is not raining or a large check-out. I will get with the valet team, and repeat that these are the only periods when guests are asked to come down. We look forward to seeing you again,Patrick D.

I made a mistake in booking the room. We have four children and I meant to book a suite. I accidentally booked a double queen. Aliya at the front desk very graciously fixed the problem immediately. She was so friendly and accommodating. We were given a great suite right next to the pool - which our kids loved. The room was clean, but we had a problem with the toilet not flushing. Again, this was fixed immediately and in a friendly manner. We did not have another problem with it during our stay. The pool was extremely clean and we used it both days and evenings. The beds were comfortable and there was plenty of room in our suite. The breakfast offered a large variety and was a good value. They also offered a dinner with drinks. We ate out and ate a little from the dinner. My kids had the pasta and said it was good. The staff was extremely helpful with our eating out plans, sight seeing plans, and transportation plans. We've stayed at a lot of hotels and this staff ranks in the top five for helpfulness and friendliness."},{"0":"Joplin","1":"29.94926","2":"-90.07236","3":"Drury Inn & Suites New Orleans","4":"5","5":"The hotel was very nice, within walking distance of alot of the places we wanted to go.

I recently visited the New Orleans for the first time the weekend after Mardi Gras. We decided to walk around before checking in and it became late in the day. I received a call from the hotel manager who called to let me know they would still hold our room for us. I thought that was very nice. We arrived at the hotel and I was skeptical when I saw the outside of the building. My boyfriend reassured me that inside was probably much nicer and most buildings in New Orleans look like that on the outside. I was amazed from the moment we stepped foot in the lobby!!! The staff were courteous and the room was more than clean. I always inspect the bed and the shower upon entering my room and I couldn't find ONE thing to complain about, which is very rare lol. We also went down to the 5:30 Kickback where the hotel provided free food and and drinks. Overall, our stay was well worth every penny spent!!

We walked to the French Quarter, the Aquarium, and the St. Charles St. street car is a block away. Enjoyed the free breakfast and happy hour! When walking home from the French Quarter at night, I'd suggest walking back up Royal Street rather than Bourbon, as when you cross Canal Street, its better lit and less desolate. We never had a problem either way, however."},{"0":"DeRidder","1":"29.94926","2":"-90.07236","3":"Drury Inn & Suites New Orleans","4":"4","5":"My family and I stayed for Mardi Gras.

Rooms nice and clean. Beds comfortable. We were in a suite, the living room was comfy, ample workspace for two people. We were there the week before Mardi Gras on a business trip. Check in evening, our toilet overflows, we use all the towels in the bathroom to mop after we disable the float. Call to front desk. Immediate response. Front desk guy has a plunger and a plastic bag, comes in an plunges the toilet. Clears the paper. Says he's not supposed to plunge toilets. Leaves us with wet towels (and used toilet water) behind the toilet. Fortunately, the room is not level, so all the water stays mostly behind the toilet. Housekeeping gone, so fortunately, we still had two clean towels for a.m. and the detritus is not near our feet. Next day, some towels replaced, and housekeeper leaves cleaning products in bathroom and skimpy on towels. Second day, housekeeper leaves cleaning products in bathroom. Third day I notice that a little piece of plastic wrapping that I had binding some brochures in my suitcase was still laying on the floor in the bedroom. Shower has not great water pressure but is nice and roomy too. Hair dryer was awful. One day we were still in the room when housekeeping came, and when we came back in the early evening our room was not done. A call to front desk and our room was cleaned (with the leftover spray bottle in the bathroom) by time we got back from dinner.So, it's clean but some staff are a little forgetful. I was not bothered by the issues, it's a quirky little hotel. With a quirky staff...very laid back and quite fun!What did bother me, though, was one day I went down for breakfast. A youth bus group had been there the night before and they devestated the free breakfast bar. By 7:30 a.m. (the breakfast is open until 9 or so), most of the hot food was gone, and the server said they were done for the day. Huh Otherwise, the breakfast bar was nice, all the usual stuff. The evening reception was really nice. The hotel is close to convention center, French Quarter, and all the fun places.Overall, I'd stay there again, I'm hoping that the housekeeping issues were quirks and next time I'm bringing my own hair dryer. It did have free internet in the rooms, a huge plus."},{"0":"Orlando","1":"29.94926","2":"-90.07236","3":"Drury Inn & Suites New Orleans","4":"5","5":"We like to stay at this hotel when we come home for Mardi Gras because it is so close to the parade route.

So often employees get jaded, bring their personal lives into work, and/or generally take out their personal problems with others at the workplace. The week we were there we enjoyed smiles and pleasantries every morning from the ladies at breakfast, Rosa (room attendant), and those working the desk. Not to leave out Jonathan, Jeremy, and Brandon, our Valet's. These guys were very pleasant and gave off a great spirit while taking care of our vehicle making sure it was always ready to roll, often on short notice. I witnessed them actually running to provide positive service for us and other guests. All in all everyone we came in contact with were great representatives for this company.

The last time they booked us for a suite the first night (because of lack of availability) and booked us the regular room the other nights. However, when we arrived, they let us have the suite for all 3 nights and did not charge additional (I might add that it was during the week). This way we didn't have to change rooms. Valet parking, although expensive, was great w/not too long of a wait. Free breakfast (multiple waffle makers, sausage, eggs, pastries, gravy, fruit etc.--not super high quality but better than a lot of hotels), snack type dinner (hotdogs, chicken strips, meatballs, etc..--again, not super high quality but plenty of food excellent offerings especially if you are on a budget), and free popcorn pops from 3-10pm. You could actually eat breakfast at the hotel, dinner at the hotel and then only pay for lunch if you wanted to. My absolutely only complaint about this hotel was that they offered 3 alcoholic drinks for each adult in the evening 5-7 during dinner (only 3 different drinks offered). We are not big drinkers but like to have one from time to time. We ordered one 2 different nights but were unable to drink them because they were so incredibly strong--we even asked to go light on the alcohol to no avail. We were also disappointed they didn't have a full bar where you could pay for a frozen drink if you wanted. Other than that small detail this hotel was really clean, nice clean pool w/plenty of clean towels, friendly staff, quiet and close enough to walk to shops and such. It seemed to be located between the Garden District the French Quarter. We definitely would return."},{"0":"Canton","1":"29.94926","2":"-90.07236","3":"Drury Inn & Suites New Orleans","4":"4","5":"We were very pleasantly surprised when we stayed here for 2 nights prior to sailing on the Carnival Fantasy. We booked 2 rooms at around 65/night each, which included a nightly happy hour and an above-average breakfast buffet (with decent scrambled eggs, waffle machine, etc).This is an older property which has been renovated very nicely. The rooms are small but functional. Everything was quite clean and staff was courteous and efficient (except for recommending dinner at Mulate's - see separate review).We were less than a 10-minute walk from the Vieux Carre, which we walked to and from several times, never feeling unsafe or nervous for a single moment.To be so close to downtown, yet in a safe location, and get decent accommodations for a modest price in a very expensive city, the Drury is an outstanding value.

You have to use your room key to use the elevator. The room was clean and had a mini-refrigerator and flat screen television that also had digital channel selections. The bed was very comfortable. The curtains kept the light out when closed.They have an evening buffet, which was very good. You also get up to three individual selections of beer or mixed drinks. Breakfast was very good also and has wide selection. They also have popcorn and soft drink area that is open until around 10 pm daily.The hotel is about three blocks from the French Quarter which is easy to walk and convenient.

This hotel is located a few blocks away from the French Quarter and a block away from St. Charles Streetcar. It is very accessible you can walk to and from French Quarter from day to night without any problem. You can also go to the Garden District by taking the Streetcar without any hassle. They also offer free breakfast, free dinner (and some cocktails) and free snacks which are a major plus. This helps a lot especially when you're on a budget.If you're driving to NOLA, this hotel offers valet parking for 25 + tax. The other hotels' parking costs around 35-40 so this one offers a pretty good value. It's actually difficult to find a parking space in French Quarter, so I advise for you guys to just walk. But, we did drive one time when we booked a swamp tour.We liked NOLA a lot and we're definitely coming back!

A home away from home! Service and customer focused staff in all areas of the hotel looked after customers with genuine care. Every evening from 5.30pm they have the Manager's reception, which entails a free drink of your choice and extensive snacks. both hot and cold food. The breakfast is very adequate (cereals. eggs. waffles, juices, toast etc) .. and there are number of dishes. Perhaps some cut up fruit would have been good but there was bananas and apples available. There is coffee, juice, soda. Iced water available any time of the day in the reception area.The pool on the rooftop is excellent with strangely enough few guests using it....which suited us very well. always sparkling clean and fresh towels available. The small gym got a little hot and stuffy after 8am as the sun streamed in through a number of windows. We walked an easy walk to the riverfront where you can catch the street car. There usually is a street car operating outside the hotel but maintenance work was in progress when we stayed and only buses were available. The hotel has just commenced the building of a new wing and originally was due for completion in June 2013 but now completion is expected December 2013. We stayed in room 821 and had a small balcony overlooking the early stages of the construction sight. Didn't experience any inconvenience or noise. In fact had a lovely view at night as there was nothing obstructing our view, but this will change as the new hotel wing progresses. You will be fine for several months until this occurs. There is a small fridge and microwave in the cupboard which is adequate but go down to Frenchmen's Street for some great cafes and restaurants. Go to Coups Place for great Cajun food and cheap too! There is no doorman opening and closing doors. but who cares with all the other advantages one has in staying in this delightful hotel. So nice to know that management staff care about you and your stay at their hotel! Would recommend this hotel without any concern. When you book in 2013 to stay just first ask about the construction progress so you can enjoy your stay free of any inconvenience."},{"0":"Albuquerque","1":"29.94926","2":"-90.07236","3":"Drury Inn & Suites New Orleans","4":"5","5":"My husband is a HUGE NO Saints fan - this hotel was great for our stay.

I was pleasantly surprised that the bathroom/vanity area had very nice bright lighting and the water pressure and hot water were excellent. Nice extras - 3 complimentary alcoholic drinks and a nice assortment of foods during the 5:30-7pm evening cocktail/food period.. meatballs, ziti pasta, hot dogs, chips, cheese dip, salad bar, chicken fingers, baked potatoes, etc. in a nice large open area to dine, so even though there were many people taking advantage of this, it wasn't uncomfortably crowded and the food bars were well-attended. Though I did not get the opportunity to see much of the city, it was definitely within walking distance of the riverwalk area and the French Quarter. I definitely will stay here again."},{"0":"Grand Island","1":"29.94926","2":"-90.07236","3":"Drury Inn & Suites New Orleans","4":"4","5":"We were only staying in NOLA for one night before our cruise and stayed at this hotel. It was very nice and secure. Your room key was also a means to get into the hotel after a certain point at night and to also use the elevator. (We've never experienced security quite like that before ).. the hotel is in a very nice part of NOLA, however...it's about 4 blocks from the French Quarter so it is quiet. I would definitely consider staying here again and I would recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a quiet hotel that's not too far from all of the action."},{"0":"Pensacola","1":"29.94926","2":"-90.07236","3":"Drury Inn & Suites New Orleans","4":"5","5":"I'll keep this short since there are plenty of other reviews but this was probably my most pleasant hotel stay ever up til now! Free breakfast, free light dinner with drinks, very clean room, friendly staff, great location, on-site self-parking in gated parking lot (not a fan of valet parking myself). No complaints!"},{"0":"Houston","1":"29.94926","2":"-90.07236","3":"Drury Inn & Suites New Orleans","4":"5","5":"Everything was pretty good. The hotel is a little older but its kept up pretty well. The rooms were clean and spacious enough. The staff was very friendly and helpful. And the free breakfast and evening drinks and snacks were a nice surprise. Good centralized location too, not too far from the French Quarter."},{"0":"Melbourne","1":"29.94926","2":"-90.07236","3":"Drury Inn & Suites New Orleans","4":"5","5":"This hotel is on Poydras Street, which is about a 7 min walk from the French Quarter. It is a safe area, and the advantage of its location vs staying within the Quarter is that it is quiet at night and closer to the Superdome and basketball arena, Riverwalk area, and the excellent National WWII Museum. It is also very close to a really good diner called Mothers if you don't want to walk to the Quarter for a meal.The hotel offers large, clean rooms, complementary breakfast, free drinks and coffee, free dinner (they call it a snack, but with hot dogs, fried chicken, meatballs, vegetables and cocktails, I call it a buffet dinner), and friendly, helpful service.Only drawbacks are the somewhat insipid breakfast, and the old building and rooms (which admittedly is part of the charm).All in all, a great choice."},{"0":"Derby","1":"29.94926","2":"-90.07236","3":"Drury Inn & Suites New Orleans","4":"5","5":"We stayed her for a night while visiting New Orleans and was very pleased with our choice of hotel.The hotel was very well located to walk around the city and a good location for driving into.The hotel room itself was an average size and big enough for our needs. The room was clean and the bed comfortable. The room had a fridge and coffee making facilities but did not have a safe. The bathroom was a bit on the small side with a toilet and bath with shower over and a sink outside the bathroom. The bathroom again was very clean. The room was very quiet we never heard a noise all night.There was valet parking available for 30 per night.The complimentary breakfast was good, there was plenty of choice and it was well organised with a clean breakfast area and helpful staff.The night reception was excellent. There was unlimited soft drinks available, 3 alcoholic drinks per person and food. The food was best we have ever seen at an evening reception this included hot dogs, nachos, baked potatoes, salad, chilli.There was also popcorn available late afternoon into the night time available in the lobby area along with coffee and soft drinks. I think soft drinks were also available for a few hours inthe morning. The staff at the hotel reception were very friendly and helpful.I would certainly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting New Orleans and if we ever return I would stay here. I will also look out for Drury Inns now when our travels."},{"0":"Santa Fe","1":"29.94926","2":"-90.07236","3":"Drury Inn & Suites New Orleans","4":"5","5":"We spent almost a week here and really appreciated the convenience and value. With your stay, you get a free breakfast, an early evening snack which is pretty much a meal, three free drinks per person per night, a rooftop swimming pool and jacuzzi and close proximity to much in New Orleans. Staff is friendly and helpful. Nightly rates will vary according to season, holidays and days of the week, but we were greatly satisfied with what we paid. Look for deals online. Our room wa well-appointed, classy and comfortable. This hotel will only get better after all renovations are complete. That they accept pets makes it all the better."},{"0":"Mission","1":"29.94926","2":"-90.07236","3":"Drury Inn & Suites New Orleans","4":"4","5":"Hotel a few blocks away from the French Quarter. It is also convenient to transit. The room we received was a good size and comfortable. The hotel offers a good continental breakfast in the morning, popcorn and fountain drinks in the afternoon, and kickbacks starting at 5.30pm. There was some good munchies especially for teenagers.

Only 10 minute walk to Bourbon Street or tram right outside the door.Staff were all very courteous and helpful. Room was absolutely beautiful. King Size Bed in a huge room, big bathroom. Rooms were immaculate and very, very comfortable.Drury Inn serve free drinks and nibblies late afternoon. We enjoyed this at the end of our day.Our highlight of New Orleans was doing the Katrina Bus Tour. It was 3 hours very well spent and would recommend this to anyone visiting as staying in Downtown you wouldn't realise that anything had happened."},{"0":"Hexham","1":"29.94926","2":"-90.07236","3":"Drury Inn & Suites New Orleans","4":"5","5":"Visited NOLA with a group of girl scouts and their parents. This hotel was a great base for our large group of 20+. The free breakfast, popcorn and drinks, and kick back made our trip even more economical. Free shuttle to the Mardi Gras museum from the hotel. Great outdoor pool the girls loved to splash around in after a long day of sight seeing. The elevators require roomkeys to access, which is an added security feature we appreciated. Excellent location from which to explore the French Quarter, catch a tram, and head out and about. Also, walking distance from the Amtrak station."},{"0":"Metairie","1":"29.94926","2":"-90.07236","3":"Drury Inn & Suites New Orleans","4":"5","5":"I had a king bedroom suite in the back corner of the 5th floor. The room was perfect. The bathroom had a lot of space and the bed was very comfortable. The breakfast was delicious and the dinner in the afternoon was also very yummy. The staff was very friendly and polite despite it being hectic due to Mardi Gras going on. I didn't use the parking but the hotel having it's own garage is a plus. I recommend this hotel to anyone looking to not stay in the heart of the French Quarter."},{"0":"Boca Raton","1":"29.94926","2":"-90.07236","3":"Drury Inn & Suites New Orleans","4":"4","5":"Great hotel, very clean, good rates excellent value for the money. They offer free breakfast light evening meal. Rooms were huge with enormous ceilings! I had a room with 2 queens more than enough room. Location was good. I unfortunately had a walking boot on and that made getting around city difficult. Otherwise I wouldn't have had any issues with location. But having limited mobility the location was not the best. My only other issue with the hotel was even with being on 7th floor you still heard a lot of street traffic even at night since its on a major street. Would recommend the hotel just on its value alone."},{"0":"Detroit","1":"29.94926","2":"-90.07236","3":"Drury Inn & Suites New Orleans","4":"5","5":"I stayed at the Drury Inn checking in on July 4th and stayed 4 nights. This hotel is clean and well maintained. The people that work here ALL seem to be friendly and helpful. Check in was painless. I was able to check in early before noon. The breakfast is nice. They have more than the average hotel breakfast. Eggs, sausage, biscuits, Oatmeal, potatos, waffle makers along with the normal fruit, cold cereral, yogurt type items. The afternoon kick back food is nice. Hot dogs,, check tenders, etc. This hotel is perfect for a large family with lots of kids. You can save money with the free meals and drinks. The free drinks are nice, not a big selection alcohol wise. A few types of wine and beer, vodka, bloody marys, tonic water, orange juice is about the extent of the alcohol. Its free, so just go with the flow!! Popcorn and pop in the afternoon also. Our room was on the 8th floor facing Carondelet street and had a nice view. Not much street noise. Room had double beds and was nice. High ceilings and large windows. Comfy beds. No exhaust in the bathroom. Housekeeping met expectations. The hotel is on Poydras which is in the business district so you will have to walk to get to the action of Canal street and the French Quarter. French quarter was about 5 or 6 blocks straight up Carondelet. We walked it LATE at night/EARLY morning and had no problem. Didn't feel unsafe. Trolley car line is at the corner. Stadium is about 5 or 6 blocks up the street. They have 2 computers in the lobby with printers. I had no problems with them. Also an ATM. 3 ATM charge. Nice sitting area to relax in the lobby and downstairs. The location isn't THAT bad. If you want to see a lot, then there will be a lot of walking or trolley riding. Cabs are plentiful and the front desk will call you a cab which I recommend. Unless you are VERY picky, high class type and expect EVERY little thing to be perfect, just about anyone should like this hotel and be satisfied. Its not 5 star Sheraton fancy, but not a Motel 6."},{"0":"Atkinson","1":"39.2335","2":"-76.8153","3":"Hampton Inn Columbia","4":"5","5":"This was our second time at this hotel.

This hotel was pretty much on par with most except for a couple drawbacks. The rooms are small - not a lot of extra space at all. The breakfast room is really cramped as well and there isn't a ton of seating although we didn't have an issue finding a table. The rooms were nice though and staff was helpful. There are a number of restaurants within walking distance, which is nice. Fortunately we didn't spend a lot of time in our room, so the cramped space wasn't an issue.

Clearly not indicative of the Westin brand. We made the mistake of not researching the hotel before making a parking reservation after Christmas. Cutting to the chase, our car was broken into in the garage while we were away (as was the car parked next door). We arrived back late at night to find plastic taped over the window and glass everywhere. The security guard at the hotel showed us a police report and told us that two suspects were arrested, gave us the name and number of the GM and sent us on our way. It is now March - our calls to the GM have never been returned - voicemail every time. 297 out of pocket for replacing the glass in the passenger window plus the cost of items stolen, but we don't have a copy of the police report to pass along to our insurance agent because the hotel management appear not to give two craps about a) what happens at this property, and b) basic customer service. Do yourself a favor and find an alternative.On behalf of the hotel we apologize for the unfortunate incident with your car.

A dirty film covered the water. Hair was everywhere. Very dirty. Wait staff at the bar are rude . They act like you are bothering them to ask for service. This hotel is no where worth the they charge. Also watch your bill. They tried to charge me for items that I didn't buy.

Housekeeping missed cleaning our room one day as they said we refused cleaning, I asked all the guest in the room and they said this never happened. Also housekeeping was performed very late in many of our groups rooms. Perhaps more cleaning staff is needed during the busy Albion cup weekend. The internet needs faster speed, perhaps this is the way Hampton makes money if guest are frustrated with the complimentary internet.Rooms should have 2 queen beds instead of 2 double beds as they are very small for 4 adults. I used the coffee maker/fridge/microwave, happy they were available but they could use upgrading.The pool was cool and there was no hot tub. It would also be benificial to have laundry on site- even if we have to pay for it. Overall, I would not recommend this hotel to future guest on TripadvisorThank you for your review.

I was in a desparate need to find a place to stay last minute that was pet friendly.

Easy access to almost anything you want to visit. Fairly quiet, some noise as it isn't too far off the highway. Had no trouble finding it. Breakfast area was one of the nicest we've seen and the service at breakfast was great, everything kept full and clean. Only negatives of our stay were they don't have any laundry facilities and if you request a refrigerator, they charge 10 a day. Would definitely stay here again."},{"0":"Upper Marlboro","1":"32.934697","2":"-117.23837","3":"Hampton Inn San Diego Del Mar","4":"5","5":"I came to town for a conference. Although I wasn't super close to the event (due to last minute planning and lots of local events going on that week) I was completely satisfied. Initially, I was so upset to find that the Hilton was booked and my travel agent was trying to sell me on the Hampton Inn. I was forced to take this room. And after all the whining and complaining, I ended up loving it. I came in very late after visiting friends in LA. it seemed very SECLUDED, dark and a little scary. But once I got to the hotel I realized it was clean, up to date, stylish, trendy and the staff was extremely nice and accommodating. I was able to earn Hilton Honor rewards points. The breakfast was FREE and actually pretty good. Housekeeping was thorough and kept my room well stocked. While staying there for 4 days, I've came across several staff members, all just as nice, and helpful as the next. I would say I received just as good of service and the room was just about as nice as the Hilton Pasadena that I had just spent the previous nights at. But with this hotel i paid slightly less, i didn't have to pay for parking (but missed the valet) and did I say FREE breakfast. No stale donuts. I'm talking fresh pastries, hot and cold cereal, eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, waffle maker, fresh fruit and assorted juices and more. AMAZING! I would stay here again if I had to come back."},{"0":"Flint","1":"32.934697","2":"-117.23837","3":"Hampton Inn San Diego Del Mar","4":"4","5":"I have very few requirements for a good hotel stay, and the Hampton met them all.

My wife liked it a lot, but I had some hesitations. The room did not have a mini-refrigerator which I thought all Hampton Inns had. If you are expecting a mini-frig, be sure and request it when making your reservations. The furniture and room colors were drab and boring, and could use upgrading or wall paper. The beds were very good. The flat screen t.v. was nice, but no HD channels, and in fact, only about a dozen channels. Could use Discovery and Fox Sports San Diego. The breakfast room downstairs is very big with a good breakfast, (although I would have liked some donuts or something sweet!). I thought the towels were very thin, and could use upgrading. There were no flyers/brochures of local attractions like all hotels have now days. I thought the Hampton Inn-Kearney Mesa was better. But, this hotel was VERY QUIET, considering all the people staying there during the fair! That was a major plus."},{"0":"San Tan Valley","1":"32.934697","2":"-117.23837","3":"Hampton Inn San Diego Del Mar","4":"5","5":"This Hampton seemed to be just off the beaten path of tourists and their traps :) good price, excellent breakfast, and loved the short walk to Tio Leo's for a delicious dinner the night we arrived in Del Mar."},{"0":"Princeton","1":"32.934697","2":"-117.23837","3":"Hampton Inn San Diego Del Mar","4":"1","5":"Shuttle only available if someone working at the time can drive it, which was never over 4 days there.

Check in was easy and efficient. Some of the staff were more easy going than others but overall they conducted themselves professionally and courteously. My room was a King studio. The bed was super comfortable for me. Space was adequate as a solo traveller attending a conference. The breakfast was good and varied over the 5 days I was there. Wifi was solid and quick. I had a car and was able to park underneath the hotel. Parking spaces were good. Parking was secured after 7pm. There is a local Taco Bell and petrol station nearby. There is a Vons and other shops down the road about 3 minutes. The views of the freeway was uninspiring but the noise was not intrusive.

Excellent proximity to the I-5, and in a minute or two you are to Del Mar Heights Road, or in the other direction in a little longer you are to La Jolla Villa drive.

Better than average room - clean, comfortable furnished well, and quiet. Less than average breakfast - I stay in Hamptons all the time and this might be my LEAST favorite breakfast ever (EXACT same choices two days in a row, no granola for the yogurt, less than usual number of bread options). Average staff. Better than average cleanliness in public areas. Finally, while the location itself is great and very central for many Torrey Pines/La Jolla businesses and even beaches, it was difficult to actually get to the property (dead ends, one way streets and crossing highways with entrances and exits make the intersection a trick to navigate)."},{"0":"Litchfield Park","1":"32.934697","2":"-117.23837","3":"Hampton Inn San Diego Del Mar","4":"3","5":"Breakfast need to be improve service is not bad rooms kinda smells like wet rag overall is clean not enough tables n chairs in the lounge good air conditioning the price is not too bad for a peak summer"},{"0":"Memphis","1":"32.934697","2":"-117.23837","3":"Hampton Inn San Diego Del Mar","4":"3","5":"Location was great next to the Interstate, and I had a wonderful view of the Taco Bell in the parking lot, but the bed was not great.

Business center is open with no privacy...i needed more private area. People were walking through area as its in a hallway...almost like it was an afterthought. Laundry was useful. Breakfast was available for 15. Disappointing since all other Hamptons have included Breakfast. Overall nice place to drive to Old Town.

I like staying in the Del Mar area, since it's usually cheaper than downtown or Hotel Circle, and traffic usually not an issue getting in or out of the city. Plus there's easy access to Hwy 101 and all the beach communities. This is a standard Hampton Inn which means good quality, nice comfortable room and bed, nice lobby, etc. The wifi doesn't reach to the upper floors, which i like to stay in. Not a problem, as they have a hard wired connection in the room that was fine. Very clean place, didn't hear neighboors. It's very close to both I-5 and CA 56 bypass, but I didn't hear the highways as long as I had the fan/ac unit on. My only thing to comment negatively on was the water in the room out of the bathroom sink tasted terrible -- really loaded with chemicals that made me nauseous, even from just brushing my teeth. Of all the reviews I've done here on T.A. around the country, I've never noted this before and it was so strong and noticeable I had to mention it."},{"0":"Claremont","1":"32.934697","2":"-117.23837","3":"Hampton Inn San Diego Del Mar","4":"5","5":"Booked one night for Sunday Memorial Day weekend, we found the lowest rate 110/night for holiday weekend compared to surrounding comparable hotels. The Cons: Hotel is oddly located behind the Residence Inn, across from the Doubletree, right next to the 56 freeway, gas station and Taco Bell, very small workout room and pool. The Pros: The outside appears bland but clean, the large inside lobby has a very relaxing welcoming set up, plenty of comfortable nice looking furniture seating areas, with roomy space and layout. Free Coffee and tea available all day in the lounge/breakfast area. Professional, welcoming customer service at check in and out, we were allowed to check in early about 0100. The included breakfast was very good, fresh and plenty of nice choices, great deal to be included in the nightly rate. There was eggs with ham, thick potato wedges, fresh fruit, tasty breads/muffins, fresh oatmeal, yogurt, cereals, juices, coffee, tea. Our room was roomy/clean, the ac worked well, bed felt great, nice linen/towels, freeway noise not too loud, good internet connection included. Free parking available in their lot and underground parking also. Within 15-20 mins. to La Jolla and downtown San Diego, very close to beaches. We were very happy and impressed with the service, our room, the hotel's large welcoming lobby setup, the wonderful breakfast, the great rate and relative proximity to other San Diego locations. We will definitely recommend and return to this Hampton."},{"0":"Pasadena","1":"32.934697","2":"-117.23837","3":"Hampton Inn San Diego Del Mar","4":"5","5":"My stay at this hotel was great! The room was clean, the king bed was so comfortable, and the breakfast options were on-point! The staff was very friendly and helpful answering any questions I had. The breakfast options varied with options each day (which is good)! And, this may sound strange, but the hallways smelled so fragrant. This shows that they maintain their appearance and uphold a clean standard (which is very important)! Overall, here are a few reasons why I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting the area: 1- friendly staff 2- very clean and well, maintained rooms AND building 3- FREE parking!!!! 4- breakfast is plentiful Enjoy!"},{"0":"Red Deer","1":"32.934697","2":"-117.23837","3":"Hampton Inn San Diego Del Mar","4":"4","5":"Stayed at this hotel from September 27 - 29 and were more than pleasantly surprised by all that it offers. We booked a one bedroom suite which is unusual for a Hampton property, but really enjoyed the spacious room and all that it offers. Room had separate living and bedroom areas, a wet bar in the living room, and two bathrooms. The condition of the room was great, with everything very clean and well maintained. The hotel also has underground parking with elevator access to each floor, a really nice convenience. The complimentary breakfast was very good both days and was well stocked despite being quite busy. We were somewhat concerned about being 15 miles from downtown as we were in San Diego for a concert, but were pleased that the location is actually very accessible and is only 20 minutes from Petco Park and the harbour area. Would certainly stay at this hotel again and recommend this to others."},{"0":"Las Vegas","1":"32.934697","2":"-117.23837","3":"Hampton Inn San Diego Del Mar","4":"4","5":"Nice clean quiet hotel.

When we made our reservation on the phone, we requested a crib for my son and were told it would be no problem. When we arrived we were shocked to see a pack-n-play rather than a crib and they didn't even provide us with a sheet. We called the front desk and demanded a crib. After a few hours, a crib was brought to our room... without even a crib sheet. After many phone calls to the front desk asking for a crib sheet we received a full size sheet for a crib. Apparently not a single person who worked there even knows what a crib sheet is. In addition to the crib and sheet fiasco, the carpeting in our suite was buckling and we almost tripped over it several times. There were also some sink holes in the bedroom. It seems that the hotel is about to undergo a much needed renovation, so hopefully they can also improve their customer service. The location of the hotel was the main reason we chose it, and it does have the potential to be a lovely boutique type hotel with some updates.Thank you for your candid feedback. I'm sorry to hear we didn't meet your needs initially with the crib. We've found that most prefer a soft-side crib over the steel framed ones.

We chose it for its mid-way location between the WWII and the Ogden Art Museums, and the French Quarter. It is also only a block from the Charles St. trolley to the Garden District.Our 6th floor king-bed room was a little small by king standards, but didn't feel cramped. The only smallness inconvenience was a lack of night stand and light on one side of the bed (no room). The bed and pillows were excellent and the room clean. The bath room had ample space for both of our toiletry bags, and there was a nice tub/shower with great towels. The provided shampoo and other products were of high quality.Since our room was directly above Poydras Street, a busy thoroughfare, we expected some noise and on the first night, which coincided with a Saints NFL game, we got it. However the noise subsided about 10 PM after the game traffic cleared and each of the subsequent nights were pleasantly quiet. The A/C was efficient and quiet.This is a smaller hotel (compared with the mammoth nearby Sheraton) and the staff were always available and pleasant. There is a restaurant on the premises (we only had one breakfast there - very good) but many, many fine restaurants in all price ranges are within 5-10 min walking distance. I felt the hotel was a great value for the price and would gladly stay again.We're so happy to hear you enjoyed your stay at the Whitney Hotel in New Orleans!

We arrived late because we took the Amtrak from New York 36hrs we arrived at 21.30, very tired. Expecting a decent night sleep we were told they did not have a double room with a disabled friendly shower but a single room on the 7th Floor(they had elevators) with the correct shower. They asked was this acceptable We were so tired we said yes Ok. We were then informed that we would be charges an additional 50 per night for 12 nights for 'extras'. Extras we asked what extras/ Food, movies, drinks, breakfast.We were so tired we said OK. They then hit my card for 3000 - before leaving London we had agreed with our card company that no transaction would exceed 2800 as we had had stolen/lost cards in the past. We had forgotten this limit and the receptionist said the card was rejected. We could not work out why this had happened. So we paid for 1 night with the intention to sort the problem in the morning. However when we went up to the room we were delighted with the bathroom and felt that the size of the room was just about adequate. I was still upset about the card being rejected so I called the 'local' number of my bank. They confirmed there were no problems but reminded me of the limit I had set. As the room did not have a fridge or safe and as we were so tired I decided to deal with the problems in the morning. The following day I went to reception and the manager (i presume) allowed me to pay the bill account on 2 cards saying he understood why this had happened. I asked anbot a fridge he said it would be delivered. There was no safe available. I was not asked to pay the 'extra' this time so payment was made of a further 2200 split on the 2 cards. We went out and on our return found a fridge of 3ft square in the bedroom - so large that it hampered access to the bathroom. We had eaten out so thought we would watch a movie. The TV in our room refused to show us what was available so I rang reception - only no the line was still connected to my European Bamk on the local number. This phone call connection lasted 3 days.and paid 17.98 3minute . So, in spite of my disability I went down to reception and was told that they did not offer movies! As i had paid I could not afford to move and so we were stuck in this hotel. Finally on our last day no one helped with the luggage. I would write a lot but no more room We're glad you found the room size adequate and were delighted with the bathroom. I'm sorry to hear your bank gave you so much trouble with your credit card but happy to hear the desk manager was able to work around it. The reason you didn't have movies is because the 50.00 per night hold for incidentals (like movies, room charges, etc.) was waived due to the issues you were having with your bank and the monetary limits you had set. Also, (and again, in an effort to make you more comfortable) a fridge was placed in your room. I'm sorry to hear you thought it was too large but it's the smallest one we had. Additionally, your phone charges were waived when you didn't disconnect the International call. I am truly sorry to hear you did not enjoy your experience at the Whitney Hotel but it sounds like the staff went above and beyond to serve you and you were satisfied with the room so thank you again for mentioning that.

It was convenient to everywhere in the city I wanted to go, though its location on Poydras street did mean the mornings were a little noisier than I expected due to the traffic, but you can't fault them for that. I had occasional difficulty with my room key working but still always got into my room. I didn't realize at booking that the hotel doesn't have a bar/restaurant and the room didn't have a refrigerator but that was my fault for not checking. Overall the staff was incredibly helpful, friendly, and made my stay. The hotel is very unique and original due to its history and not like every out-of-the-box hotel you find these days. It was nice to stay in a place with such character. Res877, Thank you very much for taking the time to share your comments about your stay with us at The Whitney Hotel.

I complained about loud banging all morning and nobody did anything or come to see if it was still happening. Instead I got your army of LP at my door accusing me of smoking once again. without even saying sorry for bothering you. I WILL NEVER STAY HERE AGAIN AND I AM A MARRIOT REWARDS MEMBER. There were stains on my bed which i let go. my towels were not clean so i requested new ones. You service was so bad , and biased my girlfriend told me not to complain about the towels or buy from your marketplace. This is going to get solved in a court matter. This was the worst experience i have had at a hotel and i travel frequently."},{"0":"Thornaby on Tees","1":"32.71883","2":"-117.16881","3":"Marriott Vacation Club Pulse, San Diego","4":"5","5":"Stayed here September 2018 for 7 nights hotel was amazing and should be rated a 5 star plus everything was perfect fantastic rooms amazing staff first class facilities great location close to all local attractions would highly recommend.Our team appreciates your review and recommendation on TripAdvisor.

The room amenities are very nice with very comfortable bedding and living area. The Kitchen area is small, however, with a small mini refrigerator and microwave so if you are planning to eat many meals in your room, this is not the hotel for that. We walked to Little Italy, the Gas Lamp area, PETCO Park and to the USS Midway. Very convenient to all locations. They have Valet parking and a restaurant on property although we did not use it.

Sleek and modern decor with marble countertops stood out to me. There were two flat screen TV's, and a fully-stocked mini kitchen with fridge. Located right in the middle of downtown minutes away from the gas lamp district this place is prime location. The luxurious amenities combined with meticulous customer service especially in the downstairs restaurant makes for a memorable experience that I wouldn't hesitate to highly reccommend over and over again!

Do Not stay in room 1501. Although the room seems like it is a bit away from the elevators the bed room is right next to the elevator shaft. This would be fine if it was just elevator noise but every time it went up and down the banged like the someone was knocking on the door loudly. All night all day whenever someone was in the elevator. I complained the first night to the front desk and actually a maintenance guy, Jared. He said that Otis elevator was actually on site fixing the elevators. They actually came to room but could not figure out where the noise was coming from. I did mention it again on Wednesday but they did not do anything. They could have at least moved me to another room. On Friday I was supposed to meet someone for dinner. I did not have his cell though. I had stepped out of the room for a bit, unfortunately right when he called at 630. He tried again at 7. The staff did not leave a message on my room phone (or my cell/email which they had). At 9 I received a call from the front desk that I received 2 calls at 630 and 7. When I asked why I am just hearing about it at 9, the woman said the note got lost and they had just found it. Oh did I say the pool was closed. Lastly, 1501 is a joined room and on Friday night, at 11 a family decided to have a fight where someone was slapped and the mother and little daughter started crying. I called the office but as far as I know no one came up or called. Just not a good stay. Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback and leave a review.

Unfortunately, I had pulled my hamstring prior to my arrival and was in extreme pain after walking through 2 airports and pulling my luggage.

For the price of the nights I did pay for, it would be been better to go to another hotel with more comfortable beds. Thank you for your candid review. Upon checking out on Sunday, our Guest Services Manager asked you if your stay was enjoyable, you told him that everything was fine. You certainly didn't mention any of the complaints you list here. We also noted you called for Housekeeping Service to remove trash and bring up fresh towels to your room in the early afternoon on Saturday, declining a full service. Upon reported completion of that task, a Courtesy Call Back was made and you told our Guest Services Agent that everything was delivered to your satisfaction. It's disheartening to read that you had complaints only after you left the property, even though attempts to verify your satisfaction were made by the staff here and, at the time, confirmed by you.

Christian and Lyle at the front desk were very welcoming. They offfered suggestions on where to eat and handed out some free appetizer coupons to local restaurants. This location has a Starbucks's that served breakfast. Breakfast was not free unless you have a voucher from the front desk. Christian was very nice and gave us vouchers for one morning of our stay. The pool is heated and felt great. The hot tub was also a welcome relief to sore muscles from all the walking we did on Old Town. One of the great features of this hotel is that it is walking distance to Old Town and restaurants. It is also centrally located to the freeway and MCRD and not far from the airport. It does have a shuttle on Thursday and Friday to MCRD. and LIMITED airport shuttle service.

The staff at this hotel were beyond 5 star with their service. They were helpful, honest, and really went out of their way to make sure you had what you needed. My daughter was taken with Tyler at the front, in particular! Aside from the service, the boutique hotel was fine. We had an urban suite, which had ample room. The two window units kept the place cool, and the curtains kept out enough light. My only complaint, and I mean ONLY complaint, was that the bathroom door was a sliding door, did not lock, and was frosted glass. If you have kids, you know that sometimes your only solitude can come from the few moments you get in the bathroom. My daughter had a grand time putting her face up to the glass and letting us know she was well aware we were in there, and I am thankful she never realized she could actually open the door. My husband would probably say that he didn't care for the fact that sometimes during the day you could smell Subway from downstairs in our room (on the 2nd floor), but we weren't in there much, and it was minor. The hotel was very convenient to the cable car that took you to the Wharf, as well as the BART and other public transport. There was AMPLE shopping in the area too. All in all, I'd recommend this hotel, mainly to people traveling without small kids.

The St Regis met our needs in terms of a comfortable place to stay, from which to explore some of the touristy areas of SF. However, traffic getting into the hotel was a nightmare, partly due to Pride weekend when we were there, but in general it did take a long time to battle our way to the entrance every time we took the car out. Service was great at check-in, but when we asked for a kettle for the room and tea, it took about half an hour to arrive, with no tea bags. We don't generally enjoy the butler concept- when we asked for coffee, which was not available in the room like in other hotels, the butler charged us USD18. There was limited food options- a lobby restaurant/ bar and a second restaurant in the back. Food was extremely pricey. The pool was not something my kids wanted to use- a simple lap pool for adults. We are asked for the kids names and told the housekeeping would deliver something for them, but it didn't materialize, much to their disappointment. It is definitely geared toward the business traveler.Dear Globaltattler,Thank you so much for taking the time to share your most recent experience at the St. Regis San Francisco. We apologize that you experienced increased traffic over the Pride weekend, and that our Butler service did not meet your expectations.

The valet was very quick with the car which is always fantastic. My only pet peeve is that there are a Starbucks and small shop attached to the property, but they do not take room charges.

This hotel is located a few blocks away from the French Quarter and a block away from St. Charles Streetcar. It is very accessible you can walk to and from French Quarter from day to night without any problem. You can also go to the Garden District by taking the Streetcar without any hassle. They also offer free breakfast, free dinner (and some cocktails) and free snacks which are a major plus. This helps a lot especially when you're on a budget.If you're driving to NOLA, this hotel offers valet parking for 25 + tax. The other hotels' parking costs around 35-40 so this one offers a pretty good value. It's actually difficult to find a parking space in French Quarter, so I advise for you guys to just walk.

I paid 85 for the room and it's right in downtown atlanta next to the marriot. Usually the location at lone would command 100 minimum per night. Parking was confusing. i don't like to pay for valet so I opted to park my car alone when I pulled up, and about 100ft down the street from the main entrance is a parking garage in the same bldg, so I parked there (15 a day). Upon walking to the desk to check in I was informed their parking garage is cheaper, but it's located caddy corner across the st to the hotel (weird). The desk clerk tried to convince me to go get my car from where it was parked and pull it into their garage - again, weird. I was put on the 9th floor (elevator is pretty shoddy - as soon as it stops at a floor the doors immediately open and shut to keep going, be careful). The room wasn't too bad. Decent size. Old tv, pretty visually unappealing. Bathroom was full of hairs, everywhere. Also there was a bucket under the sink to deal with a leaking pipe. I'm usually low maintenance and don't mind the occasional spot or hair, but this room just felt really dirty and gross. The bed was the worst part. Although it was a king, it was horribly uncomfortable. Worst back pain of my life in the morning. Fitness center is a joke. Although spacious, it has a treadmill and a bike, and a multi gym weight tower in the middle, that is in awful condition and all of the cables are broken. I didn't even bother working out there. Breakfast was modest. Literally ice cold pastries, watered down juices, do it yourself waffles, and reconstituted eggs. Breakfast starts at 6 and I got there at 6:30, and a kid that apparently worked there (no id/uniform) was scrambling to set everything up - I'm guessing he was late for work. Other people he was hanging out with and eating with (other employees or his friends) were also there chatting and having a good time. Very strange, I don't think they were guests, and I think it is inappropriate for the employees to be eating breakfast with guests.Again, for the price I'm really not complaining, you get what you pay for. Location isn't too bad either. Had I paid more of this was a more prestigious brand hotel, I'd be writing a letter to the CEO.shaunbsc,Thank you for your review.

The lobby grabs you as you enter. You'd swear you're just steps from a beach but you're in the middle of the mountains.Props to the staff! Carla Bhumi. Once you check in you are in good hands and on a very quality property. However, don't expect to check in before check in time. So, if you arrive early, expect to be told not yet. Parking right next to the hotel is limited. But there is a satellite lot just a few more steps away. Not a problem, unless it's raining. Speaking of which, it did on our trip, just enough to not be able to enjoy the outdoor pool which looked very inviting!The indoor pool does not allow any eating or drinking...eh not a fan of that policy. There is no smoking on the property, not even on your own balcony. Understandable because you're pretty close to your neighbors, but still would have liked to enjoy a cigar and beer in the evenings. Instead there's a rickety table and chair in the corner of the parking lot you can traipse to if you have to smoke. OK, unless it's raining.The rooms are exquisite - for budget style hotels. And you can't beat the location, right next to the Island at Pigeon Forge. Several attractions are within walking distance but drivers in Pigeon Forge are horrible. Some don't even look before they turn and run red lights. If you're with kids, be on the lookout.If you can't get enough Jimmy Buffet lifestyle, there's a Margaritaville restaurant and Margaritaville coffee shop less than a 5 minute walk away.Also, need to mention, the breakfast they serve is a cut above those you would find at other breakfast included budget hotels.This place is really done right.

It was too early to checkin so we left the luggage and a box of food in hotel. The bell boy was nice and helpful. We went back hotel about 10pm. The room was ready though not upgraded. We were so tried and soon fell asleep. The next morning I tried to get into the lounge on top floor but the room key just doesn't work. I was thinking that my Gold elite might not have the perks for the reward night so we decided to find our breakfast in airport. I asked the front desk about the rule of lounge access. I was told that I should have access but somehow the key wasn't function properly so he asked the restaurant to pack two cups of chicken noodle soup for us. That was so warm in the windy city.

I could tell they were doing renovations on the rooms for that floor, and was initially worried about the smell of paint that I noticed on the way to our room. However, as we got closer to the room the smell dissipated and it didn't seem at the time that it was going to be an issue. The room we had was clean, and accommodations were in good shape all around. The night auditor did a great job getting us checked in and setup. Got up early Saturday morning, went to Ikea and then lunch. Returned to the hotel around 2:30PM, and they were painting about 4 of the rooms on our floor. The hallway was filled with a mist of paint from the sprayers, and the smell was awful. I've renovated houses before and I'm no stranger to paint fumes, but I can honestly say that after about 15 minutes in the room I was having a headache and my pregnant wife absolutely did not want to spend another minute in the room. So, I went downstairs to request another room. Leonard was our customer rep, and informed us that the hotel was in fact overbooked, and there were no other rooms we could move to. Ultimately, we decided to check out and go to the La Quinta down the street. Now, this could have turned into a disaster, but Leonard did a great job of turning this around. They did not charge us for the remainder of our stay, and actually gave us a 50 discount on the one night that we did spend in the hotel. He never argued once, was sincere the entire time, and was apologetic about the inconvenience. This is the only reason we will come back to the hotel - someone actually cared about what was going on and they did right and tried to fix it. There's never a great time to renovate a hotel, but a genuine customer advocate is always a welcome change!I apologize for the experience you had during your stay, this is never the impression we like to leave with our guest. I ensure you this is not the way we conduct business or coach our staff on interacting with guest. This review has been forwarded to management and this matter will be discussed, using your review as a reference. Your feedback is greatly appreciated and very important to us, I thank you for taking time out to write us, you can bet, if you ever return that what happened to you will never happen again.

Desk clerk at check in wasn't pleasant seemed like she didn't want to be there. The room was alright plenty of room (jacuzzi suite) but the jacuzzi was misleading was told multiple times it was a 2 person tub when in fact it was not, there was tiles broken in the bathroom and what looked liked repaired water damage on the ceiling. Holes in bathmat, stains on towels, didn't service our room well, bed was not made the first morning, never stocked cups or paper products the whole time. The breakfast was edible but pretty bland, decided to eat out for breakfast after the first morning, but the Saturday breakfast guy was very friendly. Very few tv channels that was disappointing. Bed wasn't all that comfortable tossed and turned each night. 3 night stay, would stay again good rooms for the price paid.CrystalThank you for taking the time to let us know about your concerns with our Wingate BRAND.

Absolutely love the bed - I have bad back problem and I was able to sleep all night. The food in the hotel dining and bar areas is very good and a little pricey as in any hotel. The hotel is in a central area where you can walk a short distance to the Gaslamp area (a historical area with shopping and restaurants) the bayfront where you can visit the Maritime Museum where you can enjoy hopping aboard sailing ships, pilot boats, submarines and explore the museum or visit Little Italy, and well it is a great hotel with a helpful staff. We really enjoyed our stay.Bobby S - What a great review! I am delighted to see that we exceeded your expectations. We are a perfect choice for business or pleasure while visiting San Diego. Centrally located between the Gaslamp, Little Italy and the harbor, we are walking distance to great shops and dining. Here at the Westin San Diego, we know that great service is what brings our guests back. Our Westin Heavenly Beds are the best in the industry.

The agent that checked us in was rude and didn't want to be bothered. We were in town for the USC/ Alabama game and flew in early Saturday, due to our schedules. We arrived at the hotel at 9am, requested early check in, the agent didn't even look down and said Check in wasn't till 3p I asked if we were able to get an early check in to the reply we can try for 2p at the earliest she didn't even look down at the computer to see if a room was available. After asking if anything was open now, she was able to find an available room. I have worked in hotels for 10 years, and know that rooms are open if you don't sell out the night before which they didn't. Since our flight was early that morning we decided to rest before heading to the stadium, only to be woken by the housekeeper wanting to inspect the room. Hotel in general is dark and gloomy, halls feel cold and hotel looks like a bad 80s hotel. Watch out for platform bed edges at night, I have a huge bruise due to running into the corner when getting up in the middle of the night. Do yourself a favor and pass up this hotel and spend the money on something nicer.Thank you for your most recent stay. We take great pride providing the highest level of service, guest safety and cleanliness. As you know from working in hotels, we can never guarantee an early check in but will do our best in our attempts to make accommodations for guests wanting to check in early. With that in mind, while we may not have sold every room the night before, reservations are often made for specific room types for a reason and we may have not had your specific room type available at such an early hour as checkout is not until 12 PM. We were indeed sold out for the weekend of the game and our team did their best to get the rooms turned as quickly as possible. Hopefully we will see you again for the next game."},{"0":"Houston","1":"36.09302","2":"-115.17316","3":"Delano Las Vegas","4":"4","5":"We had a very good trip.

I called a week before our travel date to request a King Non-Smoking Room. The front desk receptionist informed me that the room was already booked for a King Non-Smoking. I informed them that I had spoken with someone earlier and was promised the King room. She wanted to know with whom I spoke. I did not take the young ladies name. Where I come from when someone tells you they will do something they are suppose to do it! They had given away our room and we had to settle for Queen Non-Smoking. They had no explanation or common courtesy to offer for their mistake. This hotel was absolutely Filthy. It smelled terrible. Every corridor reeked of air freshener trying to cover up the unpleasant odors. They do not maintain anything. The lobby, corridor, and elevator was so bad that I actually dreaded going into the room. Every inch of floor was covered with something that needed swept, mopped, or vacuumed. The room ceiling had huge water stains, curtains had some huge black mystery stain on them. The carpet was sticky. The bathroom floor was slippery with God only knows what. The room did not smell fresh at all. The fabric furniture had huge stains all over it. It was so bad I was afraid to put my clothes or belongings anywhere. I ended up removing the comforter and laying it over the sofa so we could put our things down. I did not remove my socks in the room my entire stay. The bed was extremely uncomfortable. The bedding was old, tabby, and scratchy. The pillows were like rough paper. The kitchen was dirty the sink had gunk in the bottom. Floors were not swept well. The A/C unit was so loud it was like a piece of machinery was in the room with us. The person above us stomped their floor all night. You can hear everything through the walls inside. You can also hear everything from the outside of the hotel as well. Very old building that needs an absolute demolition and remodel inside. I have stayed in many hotels in my time, but this one was absolutely disgusting. Then the next morning when we were ready to get the heck outta there the front lobby attendant informed my husband that he needed to pay more for the room. She refused to check us out until my husband paid her. She claimed we had been put in the wrong room. Yes thanks to them we had! Because they gave away our room! We had already paid for our room through priceline. The transaction was complete. She wanted my husband to give her a receipt from the previous afternoon when we checked in. They didn't give us anything at that time. She wanted to know who checked us in so she could scold them. Guess what SHE DID! She would not look at the booking in her system and flat out accused my husband of lying about the fact that he paid through priceline. She told him she couldn't take his word for it. Okay fine, then look into your own computer system the information is there! He had to call me inside from our car and I literally had to pull up the priceline information that she refused to look for herself on her computer from my phone. She was trying to charge us 99.00 dollars inclusive of tax for a room we had already paid for. She still argued with my husband and refused to speak to him directly. She kept yelling the same thing asking who checked us in. Again SHE DID! She was the rudest front desk attendant I have ever dealt with. Finally after she was satisfied with the receipt on my phone, she still held us there so she could call their own help line to fix the problem. She finally let us go and never gave us our receipt from them. I will NEVER stay at this hotel again. I don't suggest you do either."},{"0":"Houston","1":"32.81092","2":"-96.85476","3":"Extended Stay America-dallas-market Center","4":"1","5":"I don't even know where to begin with.

I was given only 2 options, so had to settle for one. The property is filthy, dirty, stains everywhere from carpet, sofa, chairs to curtains and even on ceiling. Bed was very uncomfortable, loud noises from above, corridors, parking lots, creaking floors, slamming doors. Hair in bathroom, extremely loud a/c. The list will just go on and on.The icing on the cake comes the next day morning at checkout, I am asked to pay extra for my room. Rude staff, no sense of customer service whatsoever. I told her that I had booked the stay via priceline.com and pre-paid for my stay. She wanted to look at paperwork, expressly stating that I can't take your word for it, I have to see the paperwork. Insisted that she had all records, but surprisingly couldn't find mine. I refused to pay any extra money and she had to call and change the rate codes. Whatever !!Please save yourself and DO NOT ever stay at this place. I am disgusted beyond words.I appreciate you taking the time to write a review of your experience with us. The cleanliness of the hotel and the interaction with the front desk you described is unacceptable, and I sincerely apologize for your experience. To make sure this doesn't happen again, I am meeting with the entire staff to review your comments and discuss how we can avoid a similar situation in the future. We continually work to improve our hotel, so I really appreciate you providing us with your feedback. Please do not hesitate to contact me directly, at dmcextendedstay.com, should you wish to discuss this further. We would love to have another chance to provide you with a better experience at our hotel the next time you're in town."},{"0":"Houston","1":"32.794136","2":"-96.80162","3":"Hotel Zaza Dallas","4":"5","5":"Stayed here with wife for valentine.

Great location, strange room layouts, modern dcor. The room was very clean, and furnished nicely (just not as nicely as the room featured on the website). There were a few issues with my room, some which can be easily remedied, some that can not. First, the shower was poorly designed so whenever it is on water will splash on the floor. The guest across the hall from me requested a shower curtain. There are no built-in shower caddies for soap and shampoo but I found plastic ones with suction cups on the floor of the shower. I thought they had been left there, perhaps to dry after being sanitized. Several times I attempted to stick them on the wall of the shower, but every time they would fall, startling me. The deadbolt on my room door did not lock properly. Every evening the noise from the Mexican restaurant downstairs was very disruptive. It sounded almost like my bed was in the middle of the dining room. I can tune-out almost any noise, but my wife, who is a light sleeper, would've had a hard time getting to sleep. Bottom line, not worth the price.Thank you for taking the time to share this unfortunate experience with us. We are very sorry you did not enjoy your stay. I am not sure if you already reported these issues in regards to your deadbolt and shower caddie but if you have not, do you mind emailing me directly so I can retain your room number and get these items fixed We greatly appreciate you sharing this feedback with us as it allows us the opportunity to improve in the future.

I was not there at check-in, but it must have gone smoothly since my husband did it alone with all the kids while I was at a meeting and didn't complain!The kids enjoyed the indoor pool. However, the key did not work at first to get into the pool, requiring my husband to trek across the hotel and lobby with everyone in their swimsuits to get a new keycard.The room service was good, but I would have liked more choices, especially on the late night menu. And make sure to ask about a kids entree choices and prices, since they are not printed on the room service menu.Our room on the 14th floor was large and had 2 queen beds, a desk and chair, and a nice lounge chair. There was a good view, too!We got a good AAA rate of 99 a night.The only problem I had was with the billing, but it was fixed. We had to change our reservation to 1 night instead of 2. The bill I got had charged us as a no show for the first night, even though I had changed the reservation online in plenty of time. Also, there was a 9.95 internet fee that we didn't use.

We only had two nights to stay, and were driving from natchez, so I called them on the way, and they booked us a city tour.

In any other circumstance this would be 100 less per night for a comparable hotel at another time/place. Thank you for your review on tripadvisor.

The bartender was friendly and very helpful with local attractions. They have free WI-FI and a small business center that makes it handy to print your boarding passes. The hotel is just a few blocks from Bourbon Street, and is far enough that you don't have to listen to all the noise.

It was a perfect location to experience the excitement without being in the middle of everything. The staff was excellent, we were accidentally locked out of our room because of a power outage to the lock on the door but the staff immediately called in an engineer to handle the problem. There was not enough inconvenience to spoil the stay. Bellman and front desk clerk were very friendly and helpful.

The hotel is clean, comfortable and safe. My room had a balcony that overlooked Toulouse Street which is a side street off of Bourbon Street. The balcony doors opened and seating on balcony. At night, I could hear a little traffic noise, but nothing loud enough to keep me awake. The hotel is currently undergoing construction by adding a swimming pool. The hotel also has a full size garage on site with valet parking. I thought that the overnight parking was reasonable (38/night). The drinks at the bar were decent, although there is a restaurant on site I did not eat at the hotel.

This wonderful lady was truly the epitome of what customer service is all about. I was pleased with other staff members - front desk and shuttle van drivers - but Teresa is at the head of the class in this area. I was very impressed with the size of the eating area. I was very happy with the breakfast that was provided. My room was very comfortable, and contained a microwave and refrigerator. The shuttle van was definitely a bonus. Not only was there a shuttle van, but it operates 24 hours each day - at least that's what the shuttle driver told me. I've never known any hotel to have a shuttle that operates 24 hours each day, so this was very special. If you like to use public transportation as I do, you'll love the fact that the bus stops are right out front. The cost per night was very reasonable for what I received. The Wi-Fi was free, and there was never an issue. I do intend to stay at this property on my next trip to Chicago.

From now on you're only someone that I used to love. Perhaps they underperformed so dramatically due to a perfect storm of challenging events. It is a holiday weekend, the World Cup is being played in a city full of Immigrants who are all as football (Soccer) mad as I am and to add insult to injury, a major young celebrity is in residence at the hotel. Along with the celebrity has come HORDES of young teenaged girls who have overrun the parking lot, the hotel lobby, the elevator bays AND the hotel BAR! There has been no apparent effort to restrict the access of these obviously non resident children who have been camped out here for days. Hotel guests have been forced to navigate around, over, beside and under them simply to get service. Perhaps due to the nature of the crowd, the usual calm sophistication and unhurried pace of the hotel has vanished and the edges are beginning to show serious wear. There were so many short comings on this trip and far too many opportunities to regret the bill prior to its arrival. A hotel of this purported caliber should never cause one to feel there is a value for money disparity. Your unique selling proposition should be that you are SOOOOO good, I forget how much it costs. While I still hold a particular fondness for the MO- Miami, I have had to draw several uncomplimentary parallels to the much vaunted Ritz Carlton service standards and the Regis' brand of sedateness(stuffiness depending on the POV)and I, for the first time, find the MO outclassed.

On a trip to SF last month, we made a mistake in our hotel booking (not at the Galleria Park) and were forced to scramble for a room elsewhere. We thought all was well when we got a room at the Galleria Park through a third-party site. That turned out to be wrong, as we discovered when we tried to check inthe hotel was already fully booked. It would have been easy for the staff to simply turn us away. Instead, Kevin, the operations manager, and Wendy, at the reception desk, expended considerable time and effort on rechecking the reservation system for a potential opening and looking for alternatives elsewhere in the affiliated JDV properties, all while making us comfortable as we waited. We hope to finally try the hotel itself on a future visit to SF we know the service will be exceptional.Dear DDMJTL,Thank you for sharing your experience at the Galleria Park with regards to assisting you find alternative accommodations.

It is right down the street from Caf Du Monde and the French Market. I liked the location because it was easy to walk to the French Quarter, Harrahs, the trollies stops, etc., and quick access to Uber pickups and drop-offs was a plus. Rooms in the hotel facing the courtyard seemed fairly quiet our room faced Decatur St. and although there wasn't a lot of street noise, we did hear some trains passing in the middle of the night as the railroad tracks are nearby. We were in the French Quarter but removed from the noisy crowds and congestion.We booked what was supposed to be a deluxe room, and the first room we were assigned to was so tiny and dark I was certain we must have been given one of their mini-rooms. We called the front desk and were promptly offered another room. It wasn't very large, but compared to the first one we saw, this was fine for our needs. The room was attractively decorated and cozy. It was clean and comfortable, though I will say that there were some maintenance issues that could have been attended to--for example, the lamp shades and sockets on every lamp in our room were wobbly and askew and required some work to make them functional. It wasn't a difficult fix but the staff should be taking care of those sorts of things when they inspect the room. Our safe did not work, and the first guy they sent up to fix it didn't have a clue. It was the next morning before someone else came to work on it, and by then we had left the room to sightsee for the day so we weren't able to use the safe during our stay. The staff was friendly and helpful. All in all, we had a nice stay and would stay there again if the price is right. It seemed to be a good value for the location.Thank you for your recent stay and taking the time to share your very detailed review. We appreciate your special mention of our friendly staff. Our apologies for the inconvenience you experienced. Please know that all of your comments have been shared with management.

Intention was to keep street noise to a minimum. Location of the hotel is on Decatur street and in the middle of the north and south borders of the French Quarter. This makes it 3 blocks from the middle of Bourbon street, 2 blocks from Royal street, which is where a lot of the boutiques, art shops, and museums are, 2 blocks from Jackson Square and as far as possible from Louis Armstrong Park. We were warned that Louis Armstrong Park is not safe to be around after dark. The hotel's location also puts you with 1 block of the contemporary shopping near the Mississippi River if that interests you.First, know that the hotel is a composite of 5 different buildings, each with their own specifics, that have been combined into one hotel. Courtyard is paved stone and very nice. Pool is not heated. WiFi is available throughout the property. Most of the property pictures show a great walk-in stand up shower big enough for 2 people but be aware that not all the rooms have that. Some of the rooms have a standard tub/shower.The first room (2nd floor) we were given was very big with lots of floor space but was right next to a noisy elevator and was audible even with the shower on and there was a drip that could be heard in the bathroom vent that was most likely from condensation. Second room offered (2nd floor) required a walk up a flight of stairs as there was not an elevator that connected to the outside balcony. This is why you need to check which room you are getting if you have any trouble maneuvering stairs cause of age or know ahead of time you will be drinking.Third, fourth, and fifth rooms were tiny boxes and felt claustrophobic there was now outside window. With a queen size bed and 2 side tables, available floor space was minimal. You could stand at the food of the bed and touch the wall where the flat screen television was mounted. These rooms were accessible to an interior elevator and hallway.Sixth room was acceptable but we had to give up the nice stand-up shower for a regular tub. There was walking space in the room but it was only partially accessible from the elevator. Luggage was carried another 40' to the room by way of a balcony walkway.the woman at the registration was very helpful to let us check the rooms out before settling on one.The next day we were able to switch to a vacated room. This room was the best. It was large enough that it would take 4 twin beds to fill the floor space. Queen bed, 2 side tables, bench at the foot of the bed, armchair with reading table and lamp, and stand up shower. These are the attached pictures.Again, review the room when you arrive as the prices won't help you discern which room is which."},{"0":"Houston","1":"29.95554","2":"-90.06432","3":"French Market Inn","4":"4","5":"The locations was perfect for being able to walk to the main attractions.

I could very easily go on and on, but I will not bore you with the small talk.Upon arrival, the staff was amazing (from valet to front desk) and very courteous. The room was perfectly spacious with exactly what I needed (kitchenette, lounging space, desk to complete some work, and large enough bathroom). Breakfast was available and delicious regardless of how simple of the options. I am a simply guy that has to have his waffles (yes they did). The staff were amazing and very friendly. Kim is truly an asset to the organization because of her smile and willingness to engage with guests. Overall, if you seek a location that is surrounded by an abundance of options, then please reserve a room. Uber-friendly in so many ways (riding or eats). In conclusion, I am glad I stayed at this particular Marriott location and will do so over and over again.To the staff...THANK YOU!Hello,We have passed this information on to the staff! We truly appreciate your positive feedback! Thank you,Devin H."},{"0":"Houston","1":"33.792065","2":"-84.38549","3":"Residence Inn Atlanta Midtown/Peachtree at 17th","4":"4","5":"5 of us ladies stayed in the 2 bedroom/2 bathroom suite. The kitchen area consisted of a microwave, oven and refrigerator. Plenty of space in the main area and bedrooms (small bathrooms though), comfortable bedding, clean, friendly staff, complimentary breakfast each morning. I also loved room service requests were filled immediately (extra towels). The only downfall is parking, which valet of 30/day is your best bet if you don't want to risk getting a ticket. Easy walking distance to a few restaurants and the corner store. You can't beat the location and great price so I would recommend and would definitely stay again! We really appreciate the positive feedback! Parking is not our favorite thing either but it is in-line with our area. We are actually are one of the cheapest. I'm sure the readers appreciate your review on possibly getting a ticket if you decide to park in the public areas. I'm sure it will be helpful for others.

It was wonderful! Megan, at the front desk, greeted us with a smile and a friendly comment, every time she saw us and was more than willing to help us newcomers find places to visit. She helped us with times, directions, and any other questions we asked ...always with a smile! Our European breakfast was delivered by a very friendly,smiling,waiter and every other staff member we encountered, greeted us and interacted as if we mattered. How refreshing! It is not a hotel for partying people and not located in the hub-bub of that environment...but it is within walking distance to almost everything you'd want: Bourbon Street, Canal Street, French Quarter etc...we walked through all of that and loved it! The room was clean, comfortable and beds are comfy! We highly recommend it to anyone..even newcomers such as we were. We will be going back."},{"0":"Houston","1":"29.94983","2":"-90.06784","3":"St. James Hotel, an Ascend Hotel Collection Member","4":"2","5":"Sure - its a boutique hotel with a great location and offers complimentary breakfast. But Ive never encountered issues like this before in all my extensive travels. My check-in and check-out each took over 10 minutes, blaming slow computer issues while I watched guests being served faster at the adjacent desk. At check out, the front desk couldnt even print my folio so I could review and approve the charges. The hotel is made of two buildings if youre in the second building its just across a small patio. However this patio is used as the hotels staging area for extra linens and especially the dumpsters. So every time we needed to reach our room, we had to walk through horrific trash odors. On this trip, I booked two rooms. Upon arrival, The first rooms toilet wouldnt flush which means 1) it didnt flush for the cleaning crew and 2) the cleaning crew did noting to report and repair. When we came back to the room after the repair, toilet water was everywhere all over the floor and the maintenance guy used one of our towels to drag around the floor and left it in the bathroom. GROSS. In the second room, on our first night I pulled down the bedsheets and was appalled to find a lot of food crumbs and hair from the prior occupants. It was quite evident. GROSS. When I called the front desk, the staff informed me that no one else was available to change our bedding. She had a formal response but I could tell shes just going through the motions. So I asked for new sheets to change it myself. I do commend the hotel manager for calling me back the next morning, sounding genuinely concerned, and offering other incentives to rectify the cleanliness issue. But at this point, the hotel staff doesnt reflect the same professionalism or attitude, and I know we wont be returning here.Thank you for your feedback. On behalf of our hotel, please accept my apologies for failing to exceed your expectations regarding the check-in and out process, poor service, and lack of cleanliness. These are things we must work on to ensure we continue to provide an exceptional stay experience for each guest.

Everything from the staff to the rooms were clean and refreshing. The staff was more than helpful when it came to different things to do in the area. The only downside that I didn't like is that it's not necessarily in the heart of downtown Seattle. We did have to do a bit of walking, but the hotel more than made up for that.

I needed a taxi twice and both times I gave the front desk staff ample notice about needing a taxi but they could not get a taxi to arrive on time or arrive at all. In one instance when the taxi did not show up I almost missed a ferry on which I was scheduled and I would have had to wait a day for the next ferry.One of the hotel managers said they had 'problems' getting taxi's to come to the hotel. Unfortunately, the hotel did not share that with me until it was too late. Otherwise I would have handled my transportation needs myself and not rely on the hotel.My suggestion is not to rely on the hotel for transportation, make your own arrangements.Hello James D.! Please accept my apology for the spotty taxi service. We do, at times, struggle to get cabs to our hotel during peak times. We should have done a better job in communicating with you and offered other options.

Rooms appear clean but are small. Pricing is still a bit high for what you get. Rooms are a bit noisy and you can hear others' in hallways and in adjacent rooms. The only perk is the free breakfast, which is just okay.The thing that really bothered me about this property was the shuttle service. So, they advertise they have shuttle service, but if you don't tell the front desk at least a half day ahead of time they tell you that they ain't got you down on the shuttle log and they act like they are doing you a favor to get a ride back to the airport on the top of the hour.

You basically have two ways to get in - one from the west and one from the east. On the west side is the Disneyland family of hotels and Downtown Disney, so staying on that side you have to go through all that to get to the parks. On the east side, the pedestrian entrance is directly across from the IHOP at 1560 S Harbor Blvd, and when I say directly, you cross the street and you are walking into the front door of the IHOP.The absolute CLOSEST hotel is the Best Western Park Place, followed by the Desert Inn, then you have a tie with the Tropicana Inn and the Del Sol. It's actually closer to the park entrance from any of these hotels than staying at the Disneyland Hotel!I was at first skittish about the hotel for some of the reasons cited in other reviews. It's not a chain, the reviews are varied, and it just looks like it's in a weird place, set back from Harbor Boulevard behind Denny's.The good news is that my fears were unfounded. We had a quiet room with a well-maintained, satisfyingly consistently rumbling air conditioner. Microwave and Fridge in room, tube TV with good Dish network channel reception (SD, and oddly the locals were fuzzy.) Front desk was responsive. Bed was firm and comfortable. Iron and ironing board worked. Safe worked. Didn't use the in-room coffeemaker because we were right next to the breakfast room. Breakfast begins at 7, and is very limited, but serviceable.The big, big issue with the hotel is that they do not have enough parking. Which is *fine* if you plan ahead, and especially if you're spending your whole time at Disney. When they fill up, they start valeting cars. We were also in town for my cousin's wedding, and needed access to our vehicle more than a normal Disney vacationer would. You may want to plan ahead with extra tip money. The valets are available 24 hours, and if one's not visible, they'll call them. I needed my car at 5:00 a.m., and they were quick to respond and get it out... maybe a 15 minute wait.Oh, and for all you parking cost complainers, sorry - that's the price of business in southern California. The state park we went to for the rehearsal dinner had a 3 parking fee!We got our reservations to the Del Sol via Hotels.com on a special, and used one of our 1 free with 10 nights, so the four night stay was very reasonable in price. I would recommend it just as highly as the chain hotels, and would stay here again."},{"0":"Nashville","1":"41.89384","2":"-87.62505","3":"Conrad Chicago","4":"5","5":"My husband and I enjoyed our anniversary weekend at the Conrad. Overall, it was a superb location and excellent visit. The well appointed and spacious superior king room allowed for great city views and plenty of natural light (wall control sheers and blackout curtains allowed us to sleep late when desired). The breakfast and brunch offerings at Baptiste Bottle were great. The rooftop bar and sushi restaurant was busy and a bit crowded on the weekend if you just desired to get a cocktail at the bar before heading out for the evening. The bathroom had some of our favorite features: separate toilet with door and double vanity. The service staff was exceptionally kind and knowledgeable and even helped my husband surprise me with flowers in our room to make things for the weekend even more special. I will certainly return here for our next Chicago trip. Dear AMGtravel01, Happy Anniversary from the entire Conrad Chicago team. I'm glad you were able to enjoy all of the amenities in our rooms and high technology experiences. It seems you enjoyed our restaurants very much as well.
