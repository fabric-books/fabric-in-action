The bathroom was very dirty and the room cooling/heating unit was very noisy. I was not made aware that there was a breakfast included so I could at least enjoy something from this hotel. I checked out after the first night of a 2 night stay and went to the Hilton Bayfront for almost the same money and a MUCH BETTER experience.Dear Bernard B,Thank you for taking the time to write a review and we appreciate your feedback.

The wall of mirrors in the rooms is awkward when you are sharing a room with your mother, although I think it would have been weird if it had been my husband and I too. The bottles of water in the room for 2.50 a bottle seemed a bit much since the next best western offered a complimentary bottle of water for their guests. With the price I paid for the room, for them to charge for water we thought it was ridiculous. Plus I stayed at a lot of hotels on this trip and this was the first one to charge a 75 dollar hold for the room in case we caused damages. We drove to san diego from Portland Or, because we couldnt afford to fly we had a credit card with just enough money on it for the room, which we had to get because my brother was graduating from Boot camp, and we had to scramble to find a card to put the money on which took out of our gas money. The king sized bed was actually a queen and the queen beds were double beds. There was hair in my bed the first night and part of a sticky note the second night. The shuttle driver the first night was kind of a jerk he made everyone get on the first shuttle so he didnt have to make a second trip so people were standing and crouching in the aisle and then he told everyone if they can drive they should so they dont have to be on the shuttle. Maui was a great driver but we did not like this other guy. I also had to get my key reactivated 3 times because it stopped working. I will be letting the Marine admins that recommend this hotel to visiting families about this stay."},{"0":"Southampton","1":"32.75985","2":"-117.16502","3":"Best Western Seven Seas","4":"2","5":"We arrived at this hotel a little early for check in so we went to get some essentials from the supermarket. We arrived back at the hotel for the 4 pm check in to be told it would be another 30 minutes before they had a room for us. When you state that's it's a 4 pm check in you have the rooms ready for 4 pm not 4.15 or 4.30. This shows me how much they regard their customers/guests.The room was clean and tidy but we had booked a deluxe room and we were not happy to see an adjoining door to the next room as we have experienced these before when we hear everything from the next room and I expect they hear everything from our room. If they want to cut energy costs then move the table away from the front of the a/c unit and let it work properly and don't mess about turning fridges off as they will run for longer to get cold again. Found the noise to be rather overbearing at times with guests stomping along the walkways and slamming doors at all hours if the night. Housekeeping seems to be scarce on the ground at this hotel at times. If we are in San Diego again I doubt we will pick this hotel again. It seems that Best Western has a special training course for front desk staff in how to be rude and unhelpful and to treat the guest as an problem rather than the reason for them having a job as this is the second Best Western we have encountered this poor service from front desk staff. All in I would not and could not recommend this hotel to anyone."},{"0":"Zurich","1":"32.75985","2":"-117.16502","3":"Best Western Seven Seas","4":"4","5":"We stayed overnight in San Diego on our roadtrip.

We stayed 5 nights at this hotel for a total bill of 307 which is really cheap for San Diego. That price got us a room with 2 queen beds right by the pool (room 103). Room was small as others said but not as small as I thought it would be. There was one night stand between the beds but we could walk around the other sides. The room also had a desk with chair, a dresser, and an upholstered chair. I thought the beds could be more comfortable. There is a plug issue with two outlets where refrig, blow dryer and coffee maker plug in. It wasn't too much of an issue because we just unplugged the refrig when we briefly needed the other appliances. Mirrors didn't bother us and they do make the room feel larger. Room was very clean, bedding was clean and of fairly good guality. Probably the biggest negative was thin walls and doors that you could not close quietly. So we heard noise above us and we were bolted awake one morning by a neighbor 's slamming door at 6:30am. Plenty of free parking. beautiful grounds, sparkling clean pool, nice jacuzzi and great location. Hotel shuttle driver was very nice and reception crew was always helpful. I also appreciated the free computer in the lobby to print our boarding passes. I would stay at this hotel on another trip to San Diego."},{"0":"San Diego","1":"32.75985","2":"-117.16502","3":"Best Western Seven Seas","4":"4","5":"Due to LOSSAN performing track maintenance, I wound up spending a few days in San Diego.

Hotels near to the city centre are much more expensive and it only cost 9 dollars in an uber to the harbour plus the bus terminus is only ten minutes walk with frequent travel to the centre. Our stay was comfortable and the staff helpful and polite, no problems with the room It was clean and roomy and you also have free on site parking which is a bonus.

I'd say mostly positives for us! The property was obviously being attended to while we there, with gardeners replanting and pruning the day we were leaving, the exterior building was being washed down. Very nice plantings all about. Cafe, very satisfactory. Free parking very welcome. Our convention was only a 5 or so minute walk away. We were anticipating free breakfast with the reservation (was discussed when reservation was placed) but because we didn't have documentation of that, we weren't able to counter the front desk assertion that we did not have breakfast with the reservation. So be prepared with your paperwork. Just about once a day, 1 or more of us had our room key cards not work, so we had to go to the front desk to have them reset somewhat tiresome especially because we were housed in the furthest bank of rooms from the office. For the room, yes per other reviews, the a/c is set up such that it's an uneven situation, especially at night when sleeping. We dealt with it. Some sort of problem with shower pipes in the room above, when at 3 and 4 in the morning (!), a loud rattling pipes noise commenced, for a good 10 minutes. We alerted the front desk to the problem in the morning. The noise did not occur the next evening, but it could have been because then there was no one in the room upstairs afterwards during the span of our stay. Sure parking was very tight on the Saturday evening, but it was Saturday night, late we did eventually find a spot.Frig worked well. Plenty of towels. Room didn't at all seem overly dated. Beds were satisfactory. We indulged in the pool one late afternoon, but it ended up being the same time as what appeared to be a family reunion so shifted after a little bit to one of the hot tubs. Very nice nonetheless to have a pool and 2 hot tub options on the property. There is also a small gym facility adjacent to the pool.We would stay here again!Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. We welcome all guest comments especally when they are so well thought out. The Best Western Seven Seas is an older property however, we are continually upgrading our guestrooms, exterior, and other amenities in order to meet the needs of our guests.

While the room was clean enough, the entire facility is in need of a complete renovation.We were very disappointed as we had a week reservation.My first clue that this was going to be sub-Best Western standards was the fact that their airport shuttle was unavailable for when we were arriving.I will say the hot tub was certainly hot enough and other than the foam that was created when the jets were on(add some more soda ash), was very nice.I am glad we really only slept here as we were about town for most of our stay.Dear Brian: Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your candid feedback.

It is close to downtown San Diego and Ocean Beach which is important to me. We eat over in Ocean Beach but see theatre shows in San Diego. They did not have any 2 Queen bed rooms available upon check in this past visit but upgraded us for free to a King size bed which worked out perfectly. The rooms are dark (can make them dark for sleeping), clean and no bed bugs as I check before bringing in my luggage. I always wish we could stay more than one night as it's my number one choice of a place to stay in the San Diego area. Some hotels charge you for parking which I just dislike. I did my research before staying here the first time and it paid off. We had a horrible experience up in Vista and did not want a repeat of another crappy hotel.

Good restaurants nearby. Seaworld, zoo, and whole lot of beaches no less than 15 min away from hotel. Cafe wasn't too bad either. Jacuzzi was nice as well. Would stay here again.Thank you for the great review of our hotel. We try to offer as much value as we can. Cafe, Zack's Bar, Pool, 2 Jacuzzis, Fitness room, free WiFi and parking.

The motel style units looked well worn out, but we were pleasantly surprised at the fresh decor and up market linens and drapes in our room, which was spotlessly clean and cleaned every day we stayed there.The pool and spa pools are beautiful. I didn't use the fitness room as looked a bit 'testosterone laden' with too many men working out for me, but the pool was clean and warm.It's in a strange situation on 'the Hotel Circle' which literally is a circular route of hotels with an elevated highway running alongside them, about 3-4 miles from downtown, so there is a bit of traffic noise, but Downtown hotels are ALL on the flight path of either the Navy airstrip or the international airport! If you are a light sleeper, ask for rooms in the 210-224's as these are quietest and not poolside either. We slept okay."},{"0":"Tucson","1":"32.75985","2":"-117.16502","3":"Best Western Seven Seas","4":"3","5":"The property is very clean including the rooms.

They were very helpful and care a lot to all areas of the service. We all recommended them the best. The second area we enjoyed as well was the dinning in area especially outside. The coffee was great we love it the most too. The service there was great too. Our rooms were good just not much space to move from one end to another but other than that it was okay. The only two areas that we weren't enjoying at all was at the reception area just one receptionist that was very helpful, her attitude was too good at all, she never smile and not helpful too. The other area that we weren't enjoyed was around the all rooms the smoking cannabis it was horrible and very bad, outside where we were staying when open the door we couldn't breath because of the horrible smell as well as people have no respect to other people around."},{"0":"la verne","1":"32.75985","2":"-117.16502","3":"Best Western Seven Seas","4":"3","5":"hotel has a fresh coat of paint since the last visit. pool area nice. great beds. small bathrooms and the faucet puts out just as much water as shower head when shower is on. very friendly staff. restaurant and bar aren't too bad. good location."},{"0":"Menifee","1":"32.75985","2":"-117.16502","3":"Best Western Seven Seas","4":"4","5":"Location was great, hotel circle.

We went to sea world, koby's swap meet and did a lot of shopping. The Hotel has around 200 rooms, one pool, two hot tubs and a small restaurant on site. Some of the rooms come with microwaves, fridges and other necessities. Sadly when I arrived at 3 they didn't have any rooms available for check in. We had to wait for half in hour but I didnt mind because we went out to eat and came back. We walk into our room which was right next to the pool and once we walk in the room had an old big fashion TV with a small fridge and no microwave. I asked about the microwave but all of those rooms were booked even though I booked my room 3 days in advance. The small thing I didn't mind but I did mind when the bath room door would not shut closed and the bed was rock hard. Also the internet they provide is WIRELESS B which is one of the slowest connections possible. I couldn't stream any thing on my laptop and at midnight my wife woke me up because she was hearing a LADY SCREAMING TO DEATH!! I call room service and they said they will send some one to check it out but another twenty minutes passed and the screams came again. Then after another phone call to the front desk we finally got some one to check it out and it was the couple next door fighting and throwing stuff at each other. The worst part was the front desk calls me two hours later to tell me they checked out the problem. This was at TWO in the MORNING!!! I would not recommend this hotel to any one. If you can spear the TEN BUCKS do it. I learned the hard way and went cheap and suffered the worst sleep that day. The only good thing was my daughter loved the warm pool that doesnt close until 10pm.Dear Guest,We are happy to hear that you had a good trip to San Diego, but we are sorry that the Best Western Seven Seas did not meet your expectations. Our rooms are often booked months in advance, especially for the summer, and unfortunately we cannot always provide last minute bookings with a specific room type. We are in the process now of updating and upgrading our bedding package which includes mattresses. As for the late night disturbance, we apologize that you were not happy with the way the situation was handled. Guest disturbances should be handled in a very sensitive manner, and we have discussed the management of the issue during your stay with our team leaders and their staff. We are always looking for ways to improve and take your comments seriously. It is the mission of our company to see that each of our guests receives an excellent service experience and we are sorry that your stay did not turn out that way. We thank you for staying with us, and for your valuable input to how we can run our business better. Kind Regards and Safe Travels,Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff"},{"0":"Land O Lakes","1":"32.75985","2":"-117.16502","3":"Best Western Seven Seas","4":"4","5":"While looking for affordable accommodations in this area, I kept finding places that charged extra for parking, which is something that just rubs me the wrong way. Best Western Seven Seas has plenty of convenient parking, and I was able to park either right in front of our door, or at worst, a couple of spaces down. The room was average size and clean, the a/c worked and the shower had good pressure. Nothing fancy but all that we needed, and a good value for the area. It was very convenient to the freeway and we were able to get in and out easily. I took morning walks in the area and I did notice that most of the other hotels on Hotel Circle S also had free parking, but none had such a large and nice complex. I didn't utilize the pool or the hot tub, but I did see that many guests were, and both areas looked well maintained. A young man did come in while I was checking in asking if they had a basketball to go with the basketball hoop. They didn't, so if you think you or your kids want to shoot some hoops, bring your own ball. It is not a court, but just a simple hoop at the end of the parking lot.I will stay there again if in the area.Thank you for being our guest at the Best Western Seven Seas and taking the time to review our property, we really appreciate your feedback. Hopefully we'll welcome you back soon on your next trip to San Diego."},{"0":"Corona","1":"32.75985","2":"-117.16502","3":"Best Western Seven Seas","4":"3","5":"The rooms were as expected from a Best Western.

This is NOT a 3 star hotel. This is an older hotel with wear and tear that makes this more of a 2 star hotel. The last time this place was renovated was (I'm guessing) more than 10 years ago. Tell me, how clean do you expect 10 year old carpet to be The lack of an in-room microwave and no poolside towels are two notable deficiencies. Most Best Western's provide some sort of a breakfast but this place does not. Having said that, the location in Mission Valley is very convenient and when you factor in free parking and discount pricing (from Hotwire / Priceline)... this place is actually a decent value. A Crown Jewel in the Best Western Empire IT IS NOT... but for a short stay at a convenient place in San Diego with free parking, the discount price may offset some of the limitations."},{"0":"San Diego","1":"32.75985","2":"-117.16502","3":"Best Western Seven Seas","4":"1","5":"my name is stephanie me and my boyfrien booked this hotel for 4 days i woke up to a silver fish in my bed in top of my arm this mornin january 6 2012 to my luck on my birthday i have a rash in my leg i found 2 of them ... i understand they are bugs but to find them in my bed thats not goood .. i placed them in a container and walk to the front dest i told the front desk girl and she said it was just like a spider .. are u kidding me i cant belive she just said that im very upset i would understad if i would of found them in the bathroom floor or else were buut no it had to be in my bed :( i reserch them and it falls in the bed bugs list ...... the phone dident work they wount even let u reheat your food .... the dinner food is grosse and expensive not a good place to stay in .Dear Stephanie, We are sorry that you had a bad experience at our hotel, and we have spoken with our front desk staff regarding the circumstances you have provided about your stay with us. We would like to apologize for the service you received at the front desk, as our company believes that each of our guests should experience exceptional service when they stay at one of our hotels. The front desk may not have had a situation that played out as yours did before, but we have spoken with the department on how to handle these things better. We are an older property, and like all houses and buildings, there is occasionally the visit from bugs. We undertake a comprehensive pest control program which includes regular visits from a specialist pest control organization for preventative maintenance. It is important to advise our guests that silverfish are indeed not related to bed bugs. We take bed bugs very seriously, as they are an infestation that can travel and affect guest comfort, however we take all bug visitors seriously since your feedback we have notified housekeeping and our pest control department to monitor the area. Regarding your further comment about reheating your food, unfortunately the San Diego County Health Department will not allow food into our kitchen that does not come from a permitted Food Distributor.

It is almost as if they are responding by a written list, like a customer support rep from India would. They repeat the same answer over and over rather than trying to listen to you and work on something. I stayed for a week, and during the week I complained that what was supposed to be a queen bed was not. IT was clearly not a queen bed. I am not stupid, I sleep in a queen at home. But the staff was insistent. The manager offered me 25 off per night, which I accepted. But here comes the major issue. On the 13th at departure my card was charged, and the charge approved by the bank for the total bill with the discount. In the next two days a second charge for the exact same amount, but as a different transaction. The accountant Ms. Loupe like all the staff there insisted this is normal, it's just a hold of funds. What funds You already got the money, it's gone from my account to yours. If I had not had the funds in my bank to cover this unwarranted second charge. I would be severely over drawn, and subject to many many fees. This is extremely unprofessional and unacceptable. No hotel should do this, no hotel does this. But they did. Supposedly the charge will drop, but even if it does I am still very unhappy. You can ruin peoples credit by doing this to them. I will talk briefly about everything else. The hotel is older, but well maintained. Parking is plentiful by narrow. During the day behind the office building where the laundry is, the day staff leave a wooden gate open, which extends slightly past the fence. It is extremely tight and difficult to squeeze between it and any parked cars. Additionally there was no handicap parking convenient to the handicap room. The bed was alright, but clearly not the size advertised, as I stated prior. The housekeeper who usually did our rooms was extremely nice, she offered my partner extra coffee for the room, and even asked if we wanted the beds made. As we prefer to use our own blankets. The hotel itself was nice, but there were just so many big errors. I will never stay at this hotel again."},{"0":"los angeles","1":"32.75985","2":"-117.16502","3":"Best Western Seven Seas","4":"5","5":"Staff was great. Close by so many attractions.

All good, rightNo...upon check-in, they add a 75 block to your credit card, and say it'll stay from 5-7 business days. That's outrageous, and when I asked why, was told people steal TV's from the rooms. If so, 75 doesn't cover a replacement (and they should rent to better people!). Short-sighted for them I was going to book another night a few days later, but learned they'd block an additional 75...this is building customer loyaltyOn check-out, a guest was complaining that she had no hot water for 3 days...the front desk clerk's attitude was 'management cut back on maintainance. Lovely. Worse, the morning shuttle I'd booked and they reconfirmed the night before was cancelled as the van driver decided to help a family load suitcases into the van......at which point to desk clerk called me a taxi and had the hotel pay for it - a VERY generous gesture!Like I said, a difficult review to write.

The room was clean and smoke free as promised. The AC also worked very well. I would recommend earplugs if you go to bed early or want to sleep in, as other guests come back late and leave earlier for the near by attractions.

I know it's moist in San Diego, but doesn't necessarily mean the room should smell moldy.

Checking in experience was very bad, desk clerk was poorly trained. I was assigned to room 159. It was a non-smk room, but has a big ashtray installed right on the wall outside the room door. The room smells so bad, they sprayed so much air fresher trying to cover the smell from odor smoking but made it worse. I found so many hairs on the bed sheet, there's a big area of yellow stains on the sheet as well, I wonder if they change the sheets after each check out or not. I went to the desk checked out, they charged me for the night anyways, without any apologize. I left my phone number for the manager to call me back, one week past, they never call me back. I gave them more than enough chance to solve the problem, but I guess they rather prefer me to share my experience with the public.So, if you don't care about the cleanness, don't care about the service, don't care get you and your family sick, don't care about they will ruin your vacation, go ahead book your room at this hotel!!Dear Sally C.,Thank you for your review, we appreciate your valuable feedback.

(Check several sites on the Internet for the best rates under 100 a night. Compare to the Best Western site.)The hotel is more of a motel with exterior hallways and no elevators. The room was small, but clean and adequate. The bed was comfortable, but the mini fridge was quite small. I requested a quiet room since the hotel is next to the freeway. It had a smal pool and two hot tubs. The fitness center was a room next to the pool with only a half dozen treadmills, elipticals, and a few free weights. If you want a serious workout, ask about local gyms or jog along the bay. The grounds were nicely landscaped and the place was very clean.The hotel is minutes from the mall, Old Town, and the aforementioned freeway will start you on the way to Balboa Park. The freeway near Balboa is narrow and congested at times, particularly when the zoo closes and the downtown workforce heads home. Plan on traffic issues.There are many places to eat in the area--ask at the desk. Old Town is nearby, but there are also cheaper fast food places."},{"0":"Columbus","1":"32.75985","2":"-117.16502","3":"Best Western Seven Seas","4":"3","5":"I stayed here for one night in a single queen room. The room was very small and dated. The worst part of this property is how thin the walls are. You can hear every conversation that your neighbors are having as well as anytime the toilet is flushed, shower is on, door is open/closed etc. If you are only looking for a cheap place to stay this may suit your needs but there are many better options in hotel circle (even for the same price)."},{"0":"Portland","1":"32.75985","2":"-117.16502","3":"Best Western Seven Seas","4":"4","5":"We moved to this hotel from two doors down and were extremely pleased. The rooms have been renovated in the past 2 months and were clean and fresh, albeit small. I recommend buildings 1,2, or 3. The grounds were lovely and calming and the pool was clean. Downsides: No continental breakfast, slow internet connection, a microwave didn't come with our room and the shuttle times weren't great for young children. Also, the TV channels were extremely limited, and there's no DVD player, but you can pay for Disney shows or Curious George at 4 each episode. We walked over to Bunz for food which was better than the restaurant. Great location, close to everything, but you need a car."},{"0":"Whittier","1":"32.75985","2":"-117.16502","3":"Best Western Seven Seas","4":"3","5":"The grounds are dimly lit at night and it is hard to find your room at night. The room numbers are too small to read and not reflective so impossible to see. Parts of the parking lot are narrow and hard to drive your car or back out of your spot without the possibility of hitting a structure or landscaping or planter. The room was smaller than I expected since it had two beds. One bed was up against the window pressed right up on the a/c unit. The curtains were so long they hung over the a/c unit. When I turned it on the air flow blew directly behind the curtain trapping the air flow. I had to MacGyver some decorative pillows to keep the curtains flat to let the air flow into the room. There is only 1 plug by the sink. You can not have a hair appliance plugged in and the refrigerator at the same time. Your choice of cold food and drinks or groomed hair. The room was clean. I do not like the way they charge my room to my debit card. They charge your room rate with the incidentals charge at check in and then charge your room rate again at check out. I checked in on a Friday night. The extra charges came off when I checked my account again on Tuesday. An inconvenience if you are on a tight budget and using a debit card. Overall the grounds were well kept and the room was clean, but had poor appliance, electrical outlet and furniture placement. No elevator for 2nd floor rooms."},{"0":"Las Vegas","1":"32.75985","2":"-117.16502","3":"Best Western Seven Seas","4":"4","5":"We have now stayed here three times and really like this place.

(Avoid Hwy 5 if you're coming in from up north. Tons of roadwork). Anyway, the staff was friendly and quick to serve us. It was 2am so there wasn't a line. But it was great to have keys in hand within less than 7 minutes. My issue with this place have to do with:1) no parking 2) how my husband and I had to walk from one end of the parking lot to the other end to get to our room. (I'm pregnant btw, to give you more context). It seemed like there were way too many cars for the number of rooms.3) The bed sufficed though it was hard. We both passed out so it didn't matter too much. 4) The AC worked. But it sounded like the people upstairs were running the shower all morning. 5) There is no tub. It's a stand in shower like in gyms. Not that that mattered to me. But water got all over the floor and you may want to bring sandals to stand in. I have a Best Western rewards card.

I was wary of it based on some negative reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. Check in was easy, and they let us add a day to the end of our stay at a discounted rate. The room was clean and included a mini fridge and coffee maker. We had the queen suite, which includes a bedroom and a separate living area with a pull out sofa. It included two full bathrooms, both with showers. I showered at different times each morning and always had plenty of hot water. I was apprehensive about using the pullout sofa so I brought a blowup twin mattress, and there was plenty of space for it. The only kind of gross thing was that there were a couple of hairs in the obviously otherwise clean pillowcases - I attributed these to belonging to the housekeeping staff. We asked for more linens and got them within 20 minutes.The room entrances are all outside off the parking lot, but I never felt unsafe as others have mentioned. The door had two secure locks which I used, but I never saw anyone hanging around during my stay that made me feel nervous about security. I did not hear excessive noise, but then again I sleep with ear plugs, so who knows. Nothing noticeable while I was awake. The washers and dryers were nice to have - you will need quarters and there is no change machine. The pool looked nice although I did not use it. The on-site diner-type restaurant was a little pricey, but the food was good. Room service is available until 10PM.All in all it was a pleasant stay. I would not stay there again for Comic-Con, as I realized it would be more convenient to stay downtown, but in general it's a fine motel in a good location."},{"0":"Weyburn","1":"32.75985","2":"-117.16502","3":"Best Western Seven Seas","4":"5","5":"This hotel is not on or close to the strip but perfect if you are in Las Vegas to golf or sight see.

I stayed there ten years ago and many of the same helpful staff are still working there."},{"0":"Swindon","1":"32.75985","2":"-117.16502","3":"Best Western Seven Seas","4":"4","5":"Great location. Was close to downtown Sam Diego and had numerous shops and restaurants nearby. Room was clean and comfortable. Only negative was that we needed to use the laundry facilities and they were perpetually busy during the evening. What should have taken 1 hour took much longer as we had to wait for machines. Management should consider extwnding this facility."},{"0":"Phoenix","1":"32.75985","2":"-117.16502","3":"Best Western Seven Seas","4":"2","5":"The room was ok. I stayed there from Friday to Monday. We couldn't even get a late check out. Check out was at 12. And we were only able to get until 12:30, and even then, they made it seem like a complete hassle. The internet was terrible. It would go in and out the entire time. As we were checking out, we wanted to microwave some food and were told the guest microwave was broken. We asked if there was another microwave we could use and were told the only one the guests could use was broken. Also, I've stayed in my fair share of hotels, and when I've booked through the hotel directly, as I did for this trip, I never had to pay the full amount upon check-in. I would pay a deposit and then be charged this full amount upon check-out. But here, I had to pay for the room, plus a deposit when I checked in. I thought that was weird. When we got into the room, it was hot and muggy. The A/C hadn't been turned on before our arrival (something I thought was common practice). Thankfully, we had our own fan to use while we waited for the A/C to kick in. Also, the fridge had been unplugged, so we had to wait to use that as well. I don't know if they don't clean very well or what, but the entire time I was in the hotel room, my allergies acted up. I've traveled to San Diego many times and stayed in various hotels and never before were my allergies affected until this time. Also, the last night of the trip, the fire alarm started chriping with a low battery every 30 secs starting around 5am or so. The best thing about the hotel was its location, but I couldn't see myself coming here again. It was in Hotel Circle, so I could throw a rock and hit another hotel I could stay in.Dear Lytrell M.,Thank you for taking the time to review our property and for being our guest. We are glad that you appreciated our convenient location. Based on your reservation details, we see that you booked an Internet Only special rate. For that reason, a full deposit restriction is mandated with this special discounted rate. Also, to prevent fraudulent transactions, and to cover any incidentals incurred during the guests stay, a valid credit card is required to be presented upon check-in. We do apologize for any confusion and for not being able to extend your late check-out request any further than 12:30 pm. Late check-outs are a courtesy for our guests and are based on our occupancy. We apologize for failing to meet your expectations and would be happy to host your next visit to San Diego and provide you with an excellent stay given the chance.

The staff was very friendly and efficient. I was traveling with a group of just over 20 people and upon our arrival they had all our rooms ready for check in. But, not only that, they also had all our keys labeled with our names and room numbers already on them. That made for such a smooth registration and check in (as well as check out). Our stay was for 4 days and 3 nights. Another convenience the hotel provided was a shuttle ride to and from the SD Zoo. Eliminating the chore of fighting through traffic, driving (in an unfamiliar area), and parking. The rooms were well maintained, clean and had small refrigerators in each room. The hotel also has a pool (which we didn't have time to use) and a restaurant serving home cooked meals on site. I also liked that it was quiet.Dear MariaLC60: Thank you for your nice remarks in regard to your recent stay. It is certainly appreciated! We are so glad that you enjoyed our friendly and efficient Staff, as well as our complimentary shuttle service that offers transportation to many local area attractions. It is a delight knowing you also appreciated our well maintained guestrooms, quiet property, and the convenience of a pool. Perhaps, you will have the chance to utilize it on your next visit. We are happy that you loved our onsite restaurant, Seven Seas Caf, serving breakfast, lunch and dinner from 6am-10pm for our guests convenience.

Thankfully the beds are comfortable. They had a broken light plate switch on the mirrored wall that my toddler started to play with and we quickly had to shue her away from and block. The tub wouldn't hold water for a bath for my kid. The thing that made me the most angry was they didn't provide microwaves. When I called about it they said I could pay an additional 10.99 a night for a microwave. Are you kidding me Obviously this is a scam to force you to eat at their cafe restaurant. I walked down the street instead and ate at the Burger Bunz restaurants..great food.Dear Guest,Thank you for being a guest at the Best Western Seven Seas and for taking the opportunity to share your feedback. We are sorry that we were unable to provide you with the quality of rooms you were expecting from us.

Best Western Seven Seas came through. This time my stay was great. The room was fine. I was able to use their shuttle bus to take us to Old Town and pick us up afterward.

Not what you would expect from a BW Plus hotel.We unpacked most of our stuff and went for dinner, only to come back to discover the bathroom had not been cleaned and there was urine and pubic hairs on the floor. I was extremely grossed out and could not use the bathroom.The TV box was also missing so we could not use the TV.I contacted the front desk girl and she was able to switch us to a different (and bigger) room that had been renovated, and was clean so that was a huge relief. She was able to do this even though it was close to midnight.The TV box was stolen from the new room as well (these must be popular in the USA...lol), but the great maintenance man was able to get one from another room and install it the next day for us.The hotel itself was very close to lots of activities, so the location is good, but if you want a nicer room, go with 2 queens or a king."},{"0":"Port Hope","1":"32.75985","2":"-117.16502","3":"Best Western Seven Seas","4":"3","5":"This hotel Does Not provide shuttle service it is advertised on Trip Advisor as provided but is inaccurate please update as it cost money to take a taxi shuttle or ride share.

The room smelled strongly of cleaner enough to make my eyes water. The two control knobs on the A/C unit were broken and amateur repaired so that they did not work. The soap in the bath, down to a sliver, was not replaced. The coffee supplies were not replenished and the waste basket not emptied. They allow people to wander around the facility slipping flyers for other restaurants under the doors not a warm feeling for security awareness. The Cafe served an excellent breakfast good food and excellent friendly staff. I'd suggest you do not pay the up-charge to get breakfast 'included' in the room cost. You can get a good breakfast at the Cafe for much less than the higher room rate, and, if you want to go somewhere else, there are dozens of other restaurants in walking distance. Next time, I'll try a different hotel chain and walk over to the BW Cafe for breakfast."},{"0":"Tonganoxie","1":"60.1014","2":"-149.4384","3":"Best Western Plus Edgewater Hotel","4":"3","5":"This hotel is conveniently located near downtown Seward, Alaska shops, the waterfront, Aquarium, eating establishments (and bars)!

Very small outdoor swimming pool (probably smallest out door pool have ever seen -- even smaller than indoor pool at Best Western Plus in Albany, Oregon -- another guest had stayed many times at this Motel for business, and commented he had never seen anyone in the pool. But, when there to dine and visit wineries without children, swimming pool irrelevant. But families with children who want to play in the pool, or adults that want to swim some laps be advised that this is not the Motel swimming pool for you. Good, adequate complimentary breakfast (2 choices) with coffee or tea at Denny's next door. Had not experienced this arrangement before, and was certainly nicer and more convenient than the 5.00 credit given by Adelaide Inn in Paso Robles, CA, at expensive for breakfast restaurant located two blocks away from Motel.Thank you for your review. Yes our pool is on the small side, but we have a large area to lounge and soak up the sun.

The location is ok for doing winery tours as you have access to the major Napa and Sonoma routes. The room was clean but the place was noisy. We had a room with a connecting door to another room and you could hear anything/everything through it from our bathroom. Lots of walking around noises from above as well.

We opened all the windows but it took several days for the smell to disappear. Ceilings are extremely thin and so you hear anyone walking around upstairs well into the late hours of the night. Every morning, we found broken glass in the parking lot, probably from a late night patron of the breakfast joint next door. For 240 bucks per night, I would have expected far less problems. I shared these issues with the front desk and they said they would put us in an upstairs room on our next visit. This is obviously an old motel turned into a Best Western. We won't be back.Thank you for completing the survey regarding your recent stay at our property. On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations.

She was not phased at all, went online and found some AMAZING options within 10 minutes drive from the hotel. This is the hotel you want to stay in if you want to visit wineries that are still open after 4pm. The hotel rooms were huge with loads of space and big beds. More importantly there is a hot tub and pool that closes at 10pm. So after a day in the sun, it is a fantastic option. The hotel has a Denny's attached but also an iHOP within 2 minutes walk across the road. However, the hotel offers a substantial breakfast 'snack' of yogurt, cereal bars, fruit, tea, coffee and juice. Again, thank you Nicole for your professionalism, beautiful smile and calm approach!

If you book enough in advance the prices are in line with the cheaper cost hotels. All BW hotels have decent beds, bathrooms, come with microwave and fridge with a good TV and channels. The housekeeping staff does a good job with the cleaning. They do not offer breakfast, but they do give Denny's breakfast vouchers and they offer a go bag in the morning with an apple, a granola bar, and a small water. I'm usually in too much of a hurry to get to Disneyland to where breakfast doesn't matter anyways.

The rooms are very good and clean and check-in is very fast. Being a European i just don't like the fact that this hotel (like many other in the US) don't have breakfast but a breakfast to go good thing is that there is a dennys 20m away where you can have a decent breakfast, and they even have a small pool and jacuzzi if you want to relax after a days walk in Disneyland. Overall a very recommendable location.Thank you for your recent stay with us at the Best Western Plus Pavilions. We are happy to hear you found our hotel and location helpful to your travels.

A large part of my disappoint I will blame on Travelocity, I'm pretty sure I was booking a Best Western that was 'right across' from Disneyland and with the inflated price, I was sure of it. When I arrived I of course expressed my concern to the Front Desk and they happily called the other Best Western to see if there was avail, but there was not. They very kind and down to earth front desk clerk checked us in early (9:30AM on a Monday) and we got a 1st floor room very close to the lobby, which I would actually recommend. The room: beds were pretty comfy, bed linens were soft, pillows were plentiful, towels could have been better but did the job. There was a fridge and coffee pot in the room along with a hair dryer. AC unit was a bit loud but when we came back to the room for naps, it didn't bother us one bit. I can't complain much about the room itself --nothing went wrong or was out of place. The location: Here is where I'll get picky. I would not recommend walking to the park with little ones from here. You have to cross a majorly busy intersection, then walk through the Cast Member parking lot (finally found a safe walking area inside). This will bring you to the end of Downtown Disney, from here you can either take the Monorail to Tomorrowland or walk what would be another 'block' to the Main Entrance. I would not do this at night time! Good thing is there is an ART shuttle right in front of the property. I swear by these ART shuttles, 5/day for a shuttle to the front of the parks and runs every 20 mins. Again a positive thing about our room location is that we were able to just open our room door and keep an eye out for the shuttle and then run to it. Long story short, I overpaid on Travelocity, even after considering the location mix up. But the staff is remarkable so it made up for it."},{"0":"Calgary","1":"33.8027","2":"-117.9276","3":"Best Western Plus Pavilions","4":"4","5":"This is a clean and well-located motel.

We were running in the Disneyland Half Marathon early Sunday morning, and we requested a 2nd floor room away from the road so we could go to bed early without being disturbed, and that's exactly what we got at check in. The rooms were very nice and clean, and the beds were sooo comfortable. Additionally, they were very accommodating of our weird schedules. On the day we left, my friend had a late flight, and they not only permitted us to check out an hour late, but gave us new key cards with pool-only access so we could swim and sit by the pool until it was time to leave.

Our room was clean and services everyday and the kids loved the pool, we did find the room was very hot though and the air conditioning was too noisy to use over night.

There is also a business center here with two computers and a printer where you can print anything you need for your trip. They also have bathrooms for you to use when you check in. The property also has high-speed free Internet which works very well in the rooms. We stayed in room 204 which is at the back of the property, and our Internet connection was very strong. Check-in time is 3:00 pm and check-out time is 12:00 pm. The hotel is 100 smoke free. If you smoke in the rooms you will be charged 250/night extra. They have free parking and will give you a parking pass for your vehicle when you check-in. Part of the charge when you check-in is a 5/day resort fee. This is a mandatory fee that almost all hotels have. The taxes on the room are 17. The hotel is not pet friendly so don't bring your pet. The property is divided into two buildings the front building is the main building. This is where the laundromat is located on the second floor. The laundromat is open from 9 am-9 pm every day. It costs 2.00 to wash and 2.00 to dry your clothes. The gym is located in the main building next to the laundromat on the second floor. It is open from 8 am-10pm. The main building has an elevator to take you to the second floor. The second building does not have an elevator. The main building has a soda vending machine and ice machine by the elevator on the ground floor. The vending machines here take credit cards and cash as payment. The back building has a soda vending machine, snack vending machine and ice machine in the middle of the building on the ground floor. You can only use cash. Every few doors you will see garbage cans. The property is very neat and clean. There are a lot of plants so it looks lush. The pool is open from 8:00am-10:00pm. The pool is heated and it has a jacuzzi. The pool area is well maintained (cleaned everyday) with a lot of plants around it. It also has a small cabana with a table and chairs and a few umbrella tables with chairs. There is also a vending machine here. Entrances to the rooms are external meaning your door is outside. It's not inside the building. Our room was 204. It is located in the middle of the back building in front of the stairs. It is not a bad room however you can hear the people outside when they are going up the stairs. If you are sensitive to noise, this would not be a good room for you. However, if you're not this room is pretty good since it's located right next to the exit. You can see the Disneyland fireworks from this hotel and the sound they make is loud. So if you have little ones be aware of this. The property is very well lit which can be a problem depending on how you sleep. There is a light right outside our room that is able to shine through the blinds. This took a little getting used. They also have a security officer walking the property at night for your safety. As soon as you walk into the room, you will see a big flat screen HD-TV in front of you atop a 3 drawer dresser. The satellite provider is DirecTV. The pictures crisping clear with very vibrant colors. In front of the TV is the first of the double beds. The bed was nicely set with four very plush pillow's and one body pillow. The bed was firm and very comfortable for me. However depending on how you like your beds depends on how you would like this bed. I slept very comfortably. On the nightstand in between the 2 beds is a small alarm clock and a lamp. In front of the second bed and next to the TV, is a small table/desk. On top of this table is a small data box where you can plug in any of your mobile devices or laptop. It has USB ports and power outlets to charge your devices. On either side of the table, there are plush seats to sit in. They are pretty comfortable. There is also a floor lamp to light up this area. Next to the table and chairs is a small closet that protrudes from the wall. Located inside of this small closet is the ironing board, iron, suitcase stand, and hangers for your clothes. Next to the closet is the countertop where the huge mirror, sink, box of tissue, hand soaps, microwave, single serve coffee maker with packets of tea, coffee, and hot chocolate are located. The mini fridge is located underneath this counter along with an extra towel and the hair dryer. This is now the back wall of the room. The A/C unit is located along this back wall. It is pretty high up on the wall but it has a remote that you can use without having to touch the A/C unit. This is a great feature. The water from the sink takes a good minute to start warming up. There is no safe in the room. Finally the bathroom. The bathroom is small just like in all of the other hotels and it was in good condition. When you flush the toilet, it flushes quick with some strong force. The shower on the other hand has low pressure. To operate it, the handle has 2 knobs. The first knob is round and you rotate it to turn the water on. The second knob has a tab on it and this controls the temperature of the water. Just rotate it to the left or right depending on your comfort level of the water temperature. To get the water to come out of the shower head, pull the little knob that is on the water spout out. They give you towels for 4 people.Thank you for your stay with us at the Best Western Plus Pavilions. We are pleased to know you enjoyed your stay with us.

I booked this hotel for the price and proximity to Disneyland. We were able to either drive, walk or take a shuttle to Disneyland with ease and the price was only about 100-110 a night. For the price, it was a good value. But an older hotel. While the rooms have been refurbished and are clean with nice linens, the A/C was an old swamp cooler in the wall and was very loud. And the only way to keep the room cool in 100 degree heat all weekend, was to run it 24 hours a day. Not great for sleeping. Also, there were small bugs that kept showing up in the bathroom, probably one or two a day. Not sure what they were, just kinda gross. The staff was friendly and efficient. The pool/spa area was very nice. The stay overall was good.Thank you for staying with us at the Best Western Plus Pavilions.

It was never crowded and often we were t he only people riding. As far as the rooms go they were on par with other places I have stayed in the area. The breakfast vouchers for Denny's worked out great for my party of two. We were in and out in 30 minutes each day and the shuttle stop was right out front.

I didn't have the breakfast so I can't comment on that.I am trying to book a place for an upcoming weekend in the UCF area and I guess I'm gonna go with this place again, although I'd rather find someplace else.

Sharlene treated us like royalty! After learning of why we were staying she offered to upgrade our room with the understanding it wouldn't be ready for a couple more hours - no worries since we were going to celebrate with friends at a local restaurant. Upon our return several hours later Todd was there to assist as well and checked us in quickly with a big smile and great sense of humor. Sharlene appeared and provided gift bags with water a snack which was an additionally sweet gesture. The room was clean and adequate space for our stay and the continental breakfast was amazing! Many choices and all was very fresh accompanied by another great member of the staff to ensure we had everything we needed! They all made an emotional time much better with their friendly smiles, positive attitudes and great sense of humors. We would stay there again when in town to visit friends in that area and recommend to others for sure - great job!!!Dear Tricia M.,Thank you for providing us with your feedback of our property. It's great to hear that your time with us was great and that our staff was able to help make your stay a better one.

We especially wanted a hotel with restaurant, bar, pool and central conveniences and shopping. Expecting we wouldn't have to leave here for anything as we have been driving for hours. we were informed that all of the above are at this BW site After arrival... finding that there was a pool but NONE of the other amenities. this hotel is in the middle of nowhere. We also booked weeks ahead for early checkin. still didn't get checked in until almost 4pm. Other folks arrived after us and were checked in before us. Another couple we spoke with at the pool were mislead as well. The floor/carpet by the bed was soaking wet and smelled of musty/moldy..so we called for several towels to absorb the water. The manager gave us a bag of candy, pretzels and two pops for our trouble. I don't want to put down the hotel because it is quite nice ..we were upset about the MISLEADING information. because NOW we have 3 more days booked here in March that we cant get out of because we booked it through airmiles.Dear LBradshaw2014Thank you for completing the survey regarding your recent stay at our property. Your business is very important to us and we value your feedback. By telling us what you liked about your stay and how we can improve, you are helping us deliver a superior experience for you and other guests in the future. I did call the Best Western 800 reservation number to see why someone would say we have a restaurant and bar when we do not. We hope you will come back and see us again soon. And I do apologies on behalf of the Best Western 800 reservation office."},{"0":"Crystal River","1":"28.5675","2":"-81.2679","3":"Best Western Orlando East Inn & Suites","4":"4","5":"As with other reviews, in spite of the freeway noise the hotel is above par, on the older side but extremely well maintained. A small but clean pool... a fitness room would be a plus. The neon sign claims that the staff are friendly - that is true - it also states that the hotel provides a continental breakfast. For some hotels that would be a few muffins, cold cereal and packet of bagels.... not so here. Cheese omelettes, bacon and hash browns as well as biscuits and gravy, lots of fruit and greek yogurt, and of course the obligatory muffins and bagels. This, in my estimation is not a continental breakfast but a great well balanced meal with lots of options. Would we stay there again... in a heart beat!!! Thank you for being a part of our weekend getaway. Location very central for out Annie Russell theater trip, dinner in Winter Park, Global Energy 10K at Festival park and Cirque du Soleil at the Amway.Thank you for providing us with your review of our property. I'd like to start by thanking you on behave of our staff and I'm glad that we were able to help enhance your time with us. Instead of having a fitness room, we did just put into action a new Fitness-in-a-bag system. We do not have the fitness room, but we offer this instead, so that guest may still be able to exercise in the comfort of their rooms with some of the fitness gear provided in the bag.

I noticed that the linen were not replaced with new sheets. At first I tried to ignore it but then when I was getting ready to sleep that was when I felt something itchy on my left leg and when I checked it, I noticed some red small dots on my skin. It started to itch the moment I sat on the bed. And also, I watched your housekeeping staff how she cleaned the room: she did not vacuum the floor, did not change the bed sheets and not really properly cleaned the whole room.Thank you for providing us with feedback regarding your most recent stay at our property. I would like to start by apologizing for the inconveniences you faced during your time with us. As far as the sheets being changed in the room, the sheets are only changed every 3 days unless there is a different guest being checked in or if it is requested. After a guest is to check out housekeeping does inspect every room for bbs, so I do apologize if there was any concern for them. I wish that I had been notified of this before you checked out that way we could have further investigated whether it was something like bbs or if it could have been our fabric softener.

There was some red, bloody looking prints on the bathroom door. Also, the dressing and bathroom area was very un-suitable! The bathroom had a sink with no counter around it. So, all my stuff had to be some place other than where I needed them (like my contact lense items, make-up, etc. Then, when you got into the actual bathroom, there was no surface to place anything on, or any hooks to hold your towel. The room was for a handicapped person, but, even a handicapped person needs a surface to hold their towel and clothes. Even the toilet did not have a lid. So, you went in there and where was your towel and clothes to be This room was a disaster. Then, we stayed there on New Years Eve and left on New years day. We left at around 10 am. There was no breakfast. When I asked, they said that breakfast ended at 9:30 am because it was a weekday. I told them it was a National Holiday and they said that they do not celebrate or acknowledge the National Holiday of New Years day. So that was that! We were not pleased!! And will never stay there!!"},{"0":"San Francisco","1":"28.5675","2":"-81.2679","3":"Best Western Orlando East Inn & Suites","4":"1","5":"This was one of the worst hotels we have ever stayed at, we travel a lot and have stayed at a lot of hotels. I have reviewed a lot of hotels and I rarely leave a bad review, but this was too disgusting to not address.We were moving my cousin to Orlando, and needed a late night hotel last minute. We picked the best western, in hind sight I wish we had slept in the car. We checked in around 1 am. Once we got settled in and ready for bed, we started seeing small roaches crawling out from behind the painting above our bed. My husband killed the 2 that we saw. We were a little grossed out but that late at night, we didn't have many options. The next morning we woke up to more roaches crawling around the painting. Then we saw a couple of huge ones above the TV. After seeing this we wondered how many more were in the room. We grabbed our stuff went to front desk and told them. She refunded us 50 . My husband emailed the manager STUART BLOOMBERG about this. He emailed us back and told us the exterminators came and said the room was perfectly clean and there wasn't a single roach. So either we saw the only 4 roaches in the room or someone is not being honest. My husband relayed to Stuart how grossed out we were and asked for the remainder of balance to be refunded. Stuart told us he can't do that the roaches must have entered the room when we opened the door to enter the room ourselves. At this point not only were we disgusted by the pest infested room but also insulted by the manager that he would accuse us of letting the roaches in. We are realistic, a bug here and there is normal, but a roach infested room is a sign of filth. We are so disappointed, what a waste of money, and such poor customer service. STAURT BLOOMBERG offered us 50 off on our next stay, as if we would EVER go back to that hotel. I have never left a hotel feeling this disgusted. A word of advice to the manager of this hotel, don't blame your customers for your hotels lack of hygiene. Unprofessional staff, filthy hotel, stay somewhere else.Dear Deepti DI really appreciate you taking the time to share your disappointment with your recent stay. I want to personally apologize again as did my staff did for the failure in our extermination program. My staff did reduce your stay to 50 off before you checked out.A pest free environment is basic for a good stay. I am sorry if that was not the case during your stay. You can be confident that we did follow-up on your concerns, so that others are not disappointed as you were.Again, thank you for making the effort to share your thoughts. We value you as a guest, and I do want you to know that your concerns are our concerns! Please stay with us again soon, so that we can demonstrate our commitment to your comfort."},{"0":"Orlando","1":"28.5675","2":"-81.2679","3":"Best Western Orlando East Inn & Suites","4":"5","5":"My stay Here was exactly what I expected for the price .

I have business in the area and it is convenient for me. Morning free breakfast is very good, hot, fresh and a large selection. Typical motel setting with free parking. Bed was very comfortable. I wasn't happy with the cleanliness this visit. My white socks were pretty dirty after walking around in the room. On check out I told them of 2 issues I felt needed to be resolved. They made a note of that. 2nd day, I returned to my room at 10 p.m. and housekeeping didn't freshen my room. Upon checkout I told the Front Desk, and they said, If you have a Do Not Disturb sign on your door at 9 a.m., they by-pass your room and don't come back. When I told them I removed the sign at 10:15 a.m. when I went to work for the day, Front Desk basically said, that's their policy. I find that policy totally inconsiderate. Next time in the area, I will seek another hotel.Thank you for providing us with your feedback and choosing to return to our property. I do apologize for the inconvenience you experience during your time with us. I do recall you mentioning at checkout that you had a DND sign on the door and removing it sometime after 10:15 am and I explained that housekeeping will not service room with DND sign but housekeeping do return later in the day and service rooms that have removed DND sign. I wish you would have brought to my attention about the carpet being dirty so I could have given you an upgraded room or offered some type of compensation.

The hotel was sold out - perhaps Management should have thought to have more than one person on staff until midnight perhaps Dirty Bed Linens - Once in my room, was disgusted to find that one of the beds obviously had not been changed with new sheets. - Luckily it was a double queen room and the other appeared clean. The green bed covers were filthy and torn. Will not be staying at a Best Western again. Told the agent at the front desk who apologized and removed a nominal amount off the check. Travelling on business - so that really doesn't make much of a difference to me.Noisy Air Conditioning - When the under-the-window air handler came on, it sounded like an Chevy Suburban on at fast idle.Thank you for responding and providing feedback regarding your experience during your stay. I do apologize for any inconvenience we may have caused during you visit. I can assure you that we are fully staffed and two agents were scheduled for that night. Second agent left at 8:30 p.m. once things had slowed down. Unfortunately, we did receive a rush around 9:00 pm that night. I do appreciate you being patient. during that rush hour and again I apologize and hope that you will consider giving us another chance to make your stay better."},{"0":"west palm beach fl","1":"28.5675","2":"-81.2679","3":"Best Western Orlando East Inn & Suites","4":"4","5":"Very clean, simple place.

Everyone was really helpful and super nice. Todd and Mrs Dena had us laughing the whole trip, we could have spent the trip just laughing with them. Brandon was great and really made us feel welcome and happy. The breakfast was alright, nothing spectacular but something for everyone. The only thing bad I can say is that it seems like maintenance sometimes forgets that guests can hear them on the radio, just a little a sassy but not rude at all. All in all our trip proved one thing, wish we could move in to the best western. Also a really big thing for my husband and I, no one batted am eye lash about two men sharing a king size bed. Love this place would come back and will tell all our family and friends to stay here. I appreciate you taking the time to reply to this survey. I apologize that breakfast was not to your liking, however, we have improved our breakfast menu. We now offer bacon, sausage, egg omelet, scrambled eggs and much more.

Now we are on vacation it would have been nice if they started a little later. Also, our second night our room was not made up or clean towels when we arrived back at 11pm. When we asked why at the front desk we were told because we had the Do not disturb sign on our door still at 10am. However someone was in our room because our air conditioner was shut off. The front desk staff both at night and the next morning basically did not care because we booked through Expedia and not them. The staff for the continental breakfast were so sweet polite and helpful. I enjoyed seeing them every morning.Our last night all we heard all night was a dog barking.

Breakfast room too small for the number of people staying (many took food to their rooms). Only other disappointment was that our room had only a shower, not a full bath. We are sorry you were disappointed with some aspects of your stay. We strive to make every guest happy and comfortable. We have had a very very busy Spring season and the hotel has been at capacity many days. Unfortunately that has meant that our breakfast area has been a bit crowded some mornings when everyone shows up at the same time. We do provide outdoor seating to alleviate some of the space issues. Our breakfast is pretty extensive with eggs, meat, pancakes, cereals, fruits, breads, etc - so guests may also linger a bit longer than at other less complete breakfasts. Our regular rooms do feature a glass shower with a separate granite vanity area. This design was created due to guest reviews and requests. It seems that most guests prefer a shower and the tub was wasted space. We do have a few handicap access rooms that have tubs, so if you return to the area, please inquire about them. There bathroom set up may work better for you. We hope you will come see us again!"},{"0":"Vancouver","1":"28.4193","2":"-81.4644","3":"Best Western Orlando Convention Center Hotel","4":"4","5":"This hotel has recently been renamed the Best Western Plus. When telling taxi drivers where you are staying, you may have to refer to it as the Windsor Inn or Sleep Inn. The confusion in names made it difficult for the airline to return a piece of lost baggage, since they didn't have the new name in their computer system. We booked our room on www.hotels.ca and got a room with 2 double beds for 49/night.I stayed here on October 18-21 to visit Universal Studios and do some shopping prior to a conference at the Orange County Convention Centre. As two female travelers, we felt safe and enjoyed the many perks of staying at this hotel. LOCATION: This hotel has a fantastic location! It's located right off I-Drive, and there is an I-Trolley stop right across the street. You can easily reach both outlet malls on the I-Trolley. There is a shuttle that takes guests to Universal Studios, SeaWorld and Disneyworld. They drop-off in the morning, and return for pick-up twice in the evening. This means that you have to stay at the park for a decent amount of time. The shuttle is quick and pain-free.BREAKFAST: The breakfasts are fantastic. It is hectic around 8:30 AM when everybody is getting ready to visit the theme-parks. This makes breakfast a rather rushed affair since there are limited tables, and it is not always desirable to sit outside because of the weather. The buffet consisted of: pancakes, bacon/sausage, eggs, pastries, oranges, and juice. Of course, all of the jam included corn syrup, as did the pancake syrup. There are whole-wheat English muffins.THEME PARK TICKETS: There is a person who sells tickets to the theme parks at a 'discount.' After talking to him, I determined that purchasing from his is not that different from purchasing online. He sells Universal Studios 2-day park-to-park passes for 130 cash, or 135 with a credit card. He also had Disneyworld tickets for 30 off, however, this only applied with a group of three or more, and this was with a special 'employee voucher,' for which you had to notify him one day in advance, and go with him to the park to purchase the tickets. From my observations of his interactions with other guests, he didn't seem particularly keen to garner business, so I would probably look around for better deals.AMENITIES: The rooms were simple, but great. They hotel is newly renovated, and each has a safe. Although the bathroom had a funky odour, I think this is more likely attributed to the smell in Orlando's tap water, rather than hotel cleanliness.STAFF: I cannot describe how wonderful the staff were. We were greeted by Derek, who directed us to our room, and provided suggestions on where to eat. We also met another staff member named Derek, who was most courteous and helpful. There was no problem stowing our luggage with the desk since we went to a theme park after checking out... however, I was rather shocked that they did not ask for any ID to make sure that we were the owners when picking up our luggage afterwards.OVERALL: A wonderful hotel, and a great way to save money, particularly with a family.

The rooms remain comfortable, however my only hang up is what I would call a design flaw rather than a hotel comfort/staffing issue.

The hotel itself is newly renovated.The hotel is a quick walk from Seaworld and provides a free shuttle to Disney. The free breakfast was pretty standard but had some of the best hotel coffe Ive experienced. On the nights that I didnt eat supper at the parks, I ate at a nearby restaurant called Village Inn. I usually just ate breakfast for supper but it was good and reasonably priced.Im looking forward to returning for my next trip!Thank you for your kind comments. We are always pleased to hear that guests enjoyed their stay with us. We are now called the Best Western Plus Orlando Convention Center Hotel. We have upgraded a few more things since your stay.

Attentive, full of information, courteous and smiling. The room (407) was quiet during the night. A free breakfast is always a plus. The coffee in the room was ok. Complimentary water. Bigger frig and TV. A free outlet next to the bed! The price. Good location. Village Inn next door.The bad: uh oh. What's that on the floor Housekeeping left a little souvenir behind. Don't bother paying more for executive room. Small room with only toilet and small shower in bathroom. Sink outside bathroom. Bright parking lot light at night. Told by one employee when I called the hotel that Sea World had fireworks at night so made special requests for Sea World facing room. They didn't. Breakfast eggs were of the powdered kind. No yogurt. (But then again, I can't complain - it was satisfactory and free.) Pool was basically bordered by parking lot. (Nobody used it during my stay.) No shopping within walking distance. I've stayed in new BW Plus hotels and this is not a Plus. Probably wont stay here again. If you found my review helpful, please click on yes.

I decided to try the Best Western and was pleased with it. The only negative was that the wireless service in my room wasn't great. It dropped me several times. Breakfast was good with hot food. All the staff were pleasant and good to work with. The room was clean and comfortable. The bed was a little on the hard side for my liking but not bad. I didn't have any problem sleeping. Our room was right next to the elevator which I usually don't like but never heard it the whole time. The fitness center had good equipment in it that worked well. There is an outdoor pool but it was too cool for a swim (though there were kids enjoying it).The price was good so I'd stay another time I'm in the area. The Village Inn restaurant right next door is a good family restaurant to eat at while staying at the Best Western. Prices were very good and serving sizes were large.

Very clean room, comfy beds and good customer service. Breakfast was modest but very good. Served in a small area though so make sure that you're not late. Two important (and I believe useful) notes - there's only Family restaurant close by and a small grocery y store at Gas station.The good thing is that the Hotel is located on International drive and there is a I-Ride Trolley station next to the hotel. There are lots of dining, shopping places, attractions and major sea parks on International drive and I-Ride trolley can take you there for only 1.25 per person.

There were a few positives but my initial 3/5 evaluation was influenced downward by the unfavourable opinions of my brother and adult son who traveled with me. Pluses included a breakfast with hot options and adequate space for seating, not always a given. The front end staff were friendly. The room was good value for a name brand this time of year.The small room however was below par in several ways. Had I been with my wife, I would have requested a move. Most critically, it was excessively musty smelling, noticeable as the door opened. The carpet felt damp and the issue was illustrated by the delamination on the doors of the cabinet. This had to be an undoing issue. There was a large piece of sticky green gum stuck to the seat of the lounge chair, impossible to miss during housekeeping. The toilet ran constantly. Lessor issues include limited toiletries such as a single bar of soap to share between the sink and (separate) shower areas. The lighting in the shower area was weak leaving the shower in shadow. All in all, given the miriad of options in the area, I'd suggest guests look elsewhere."},{"0":"Dallas","1":"28.4193","2":"-81.4644","3":"Best Western Orlando Convention Center Hotel","4":"3","5":"If you need a place to lay your head and rest, this is a great place.

No refrigerator or microwave, but they do have a restaurant in the place that was most pleasant.We didn't use the pool, but it looked quite nice.The noise from the planes was not even heard due to the air conditioner in the room.Thank you very much for taking the time to share your comments about your stay with us.

Hotel is charming and the staff was so very friendly. Rooms were clean, spacious and breakfast was good. Beds were very comfortable. Loved that there were tables and chairs so we could sit outside. The garden district is so quiet compared to French Quarter. Loved the area and will be back to stay here again. Restaurant next door, Fresh Market and the Grocery right up the street. A few blocks to Magazine St. The staff could not have been friendlier. Loved talking with all of them. After staying in the French Quarter and here, this will be my first choice from now on. Can't wait to to go back.I'm happy to hear you had such a great stay! I love the area the hotel is located in. There is plenty to do and see, while still being much quieter than the French Quarter.

However, the actual street the hotel was on was pleasant and in the Garden district. Parking was gated, which was nice. It's also easy to catch a streetcar outside the hotel. It runs every 10 minutes. It was about a 25 minute street car ride. It took about 10 minutes to get to Canal and Burbon street area in our persona vehicle. The beds were comfortable, but were small (full size I believe). We were able fit 2 adults and 2 children in the room. The decor was nice and the lobby was average. We found clothes that were left behind in one of the drawers. The room was fairly clean. The whole hotel smelled like cleaning solution. We stayed one night and did not spend alot of time in our room. It was good for the price. There's also a simple restaurant and bar next door.Monica,Thank you for taking the time to write your review. Our rooms with two beds have two double beds in them. I'm glad you found them to be comfortable! It sounds like your family was able to do a lot in just one night in New Orleans. We are located in the Garden District, which is safe and quieter than other areas of the city. Luckily, the street car makes it easy to get to other parts of the city! It is great that our guests can take advantage of our free parking and use the streetcar.

The hotel is very conveniently located on St. Charles, about halfway between Tulane/Loyola and downtown New Orleans. The tram runs in front of the hotel, but we never heard a thing from our room. It is walking distance from Commander's Palace, where we had an unforgettable dinner one evening. You are right there to see all the beautiful homes of the Garden District and to visit Magazine street. The hotel itself is so accommodating. The breakfast is bountiful - hot and cold items, and lots of fresh fruit. They keep coffee, tea and fresh-fruit-flavored chilled water available all day. In the afternoon they put out warm, fresh-baked cookies. In the evening, there are grapes and cheese. All on the house! There is a decent-enough and very friendly Mexican-style restaurant and lounge attached. We ate there our first evening and cannot complain. What is nice, once again, is that the restaurant is a bit loud, but we never heard it from our room. Everything about this hotel is great.

Especially during Mardi Gras, when this area is near parade routes, but even at other times, this hotel is more expensive than the Best Western St. Christopher (on the edge of the French Quarter). I think the biggest difference between the two is the location that you prefer. I don't want to pay more to stay in the Garden District, but I could think of people who would.Rooms. These are a little smaller than normal and don't have work desks or in-room safes. My room faced the parking lot behind the hotel and was fairly quiet. On previous visits I didn't have a problem with noise either. I love the room decor which is bright and contemporary. It looks better than most BWs I've visited. Also, there is an extra sink next to the closet space near the door, which works well when there are multiple people in a room.Location. It is on St. Charles with a streetcar stop almost in front of the hotel. St. Charles and its nearby areas have more good restaurants than the French Quarter IMO and the streetcar is an incredibly efficient way of getting to them. Also, the French Quarter is not walking distance from the hotel, but the streetcar takes you to Canal Street, which is the border of the Quarter. The hotel is also quite close to Loyola and Tulane Universities as well as Audubon Park/Zoo. This particular area of St. Charles is residential. It should be noted that part of the hotel is built on top of a restaurant, Superior Grill. This is convenient, but it enhances the possibility for noise. It hasn't bothered me, but I've never been in a room directly over it.Cleanliness. The room was reasonably clean. I was there for a half-marathon and spent more time than normal in the bathroom to ice my legs. I noticed that the bathroom wasn't exactly spotless, but it wasn't anything you'd notice unless you spent 30-45 minutes in there looking around. Service. The front desk staff struck me as nice, but in a couple of cases simply weren't able to accommodate me. I arrived around 3:15PM and my room was not ready. Since the hotel was fully booked, they couldn't give me another room. I waited in the lobby for a little more than an hour and two calls by the clerk to the housekeeper and my room still wasn't ready. The clerk agreed to hold my bag while I went next door to Superior Grill to eat dinner. I returned about 6:30PM and my room was ready. I was not the only person waiting for a room. (Throughout my stay, I noticed that housekeeping seemed to occur late in the day, about 1-4 PM. It wasn't difficult to notice because the housekeeper on our floor blasted music in the rooms she was cleaning.) Second, I asked the front desk for some information about street closures occurring that weekend and they weren't aware of them. It's a relatively minor issue, but there were multiple people asking and they never got answers.Sleep Quality. My room was quiet and the bed relatively decent.Notes. The surface on the second floor slopes a bit which can feel weird initially. They have a bookshelf with books for guests to read while there."},{"0":"Tallahassee","1":"29.926972","2":"-90.094341","3":"Best Western Plus St Charles Inn","4":"3","5":"We have stayed there previously. Location is convenient, most front desk people are very helpful, breakfast is all right. Rooms can be noisy.However: we were given room 209 which had its only window 3' from the restaurant exhaust system. The smell of food permeated the room. And, the A/C could not be used because it, too, was adjacent to the exhaust. We thought we would give it a try until my wife found hairs and red spots on the sheet.The front desk lady was extremely nice and pleasant as she is always. We moved to another room that had a roll away in it. Quickly I noticed black residue appearing on the white sheets. A quick check of the A/C filter showed it must not have been changed since Katrina...........black mold was all over the filter. And, on the sheets. The bathroom was not cleaned well. Hairs were around the tub and elsewhere. In short, housekeeping is not good. Cleaning is not acceptable. We elected to stay because we were tired of moving rooms and did not want to try and find another motel. Perhaps we should have done so. Overall, this place has potential but it needs a thorough cleaning as it has become mediocre Close off the room next to the restaurant exhaust. Clean the carpets and clean the rooms thoroughly. We will try the next door Hampton Inn next visit."},{"0":"San Francisco","1":"29.926972","2":"-90.094341","3":"Best Western Plus St Charles Inn","4":"3","5":"pros-great location, across the street from the St. Charles street car -beautiful neighborhood (Garden District) -great restaurant next door (Superior Grill) -gated free parkingcons-breakfast was less than desirable (and we have stayed at many, many BWs across the nation) - room was on the small side -noisy on the dumpster side of the building - plumbing problems (toilet overflowed-wasn't cleaned like we thought it could have been, in the young man's defense, we did not say anything to him for him to be able to remedy- we get it- it was gross) (it's old-we get it) -could have been cleaner- stair case doesn't look like it has been vacuumed in a long time.Ann,I'm very sorry that you did not enjoy your stay with us.

The breakfast was very good with hot items. and a variety of fruit to add to our oatmeal (though it would have been nice to have hot oatmeal and not the packets).

Rooms are dark and in need of deep cleaning. Unfriendly staff. Dark alley way from parking lot to the back door of the hotel. The work out area was used as a storage room. The only thing going for this hotel was the free parking and location to the trolley.Maureen,I am so sorry you were unhappy with your stay. We were unable to find any evidence of the bug you saw in your room. Ecolab thoroughly inspected the room, and found no insect activity. We did have the room treated out of an abundance of caution. I am happy we were able to change your room immediately, and I provided you with a discount for the inconvenience of changing rooms.The fitness center was being used for storage for a few days. We excited to be doing some upgrades to our public areas this summer. As a small hotel there is not a lot of extra room. I am happy to report those items have been moved out as of today (08/14/17)! Unfortunately this happens from time to time as we make improvements to the hotel. We made sure as much of the equipment as possible was accessible, and we would always be happy to provide a guest pass to a local gym if our storage inconveninced a guest.

First noticed while lying in bed and got bit. Thought it was a fleeting incident and left for the day. That night I was in bed and felt them on me, I got up walked across room and saw fleas were all over my lower legs. Needless to say I did not sleep that night. First thing in the morning asked for a new room and they did move us, however I was paranoid the fleas got into my things and would come home with me. So I felt very anxious and uncomfortable the rest of my stay. I have bite marks all over my legs. They didn't even offer a discount of any kind off that room price.Thank you for taking the time to write your review. I am very sorry that happened during your stay. I am very glad we were able to move you to another room, and we have gotten the original room taken care of. We do have a cleaning policy in place when we know a pet has been in a room. There was no record of any pets in that room for several months. Unfortunately, it sounds like someone may have had a pet in that room without us knowing.

You can take the Streetcar and be in the French Quarter within a half of an hour. I plan on staying at this hotel again the next time we visit New Orleans"},{"0":"Canberra","1":"29.926972","2":"-90.094341","3":"Best Western Plus St Charles Inn","4":"2","5":"My wife and I stayed at this hotel for two nights, arriving on Tuesday 7 October and departing Thursday 9th. I was very disappointed.My reservation for this stay was confirmed in January 2014. It was prepaid, and the charge was posted to my credit card account on 10 January last. I selected the hotel partly for its location, partly because it offered the facilities and amenities I sought, and partly because of good reviews on TripAdvisor.When we arrived at the hotel on 7 October, the lady on the front counter told me the MasterCard I presented was declined, and requested another card. Since I knew there was nothing wrong with my card or account, I stood my ground. Reluctantly she tried again, and succeeded. But that was clearly not her first choice.I told her the reservation was prepaid, which she denied. She said it would be charged to my card. After I got settled in my room I went online and downloaded a copy of my credit card statement for the month of January (showing the charge for this stay), which I showed the front desk lady. Reluctantly she agreed and asked pointedly It has not been charged to your account here, has itOne of the amenities that drove my choice of this hotel was free parking, as advertised on the hotels website. What it does not say is that there are only 40 or 41 spaces, given out on a first come first served basis. When we arrived they had all been given out. Because we were staying two nights I was permitted to park on the street in front of the hotel, rather than off-site (the other option). Neither of those options fits what I understand when a hotel advertises free parking. (I was given access to the hotel's parking area for our second night.)When we reached our room we were very disappointed at its size. There was neither room nor a stand to open two suitcases one case occupied the armchair, leaving only the desk chair for seating. This does not conform with what I expect from a Best Western, let alone a Best Western Plus hotel. And at 161 per night I consider it over-priced, though most hotels of this standard in New Orleans seem to charge around this figure.On both mornings we were at the hotel, when I stepped into the bath to shower there appeared black grime on the bath from my feet this came from the carpet. I complained the first morning and asked that the floor be vacuumed, but the problem was still there the second morning. I consider that the carpet in that room requires a shampoo.Finally, on both mornings when we came to breakfast the four tables provided were all fully used. On the first morning we had our breakfast in the Business Centre on the second morning we waited until other guests left.On the morning of our departure there appeared under the door a statement which, in the light of the initial denial that the reservation was prepaid, could have meant that the hotel had charged the stay to my credit card on the day of my arrival. The lady at the front desk on departure morning clarified that, though I must say bringing a January payment into the hotels account on 7 October seems a strange way to keep books. But the total of this statement exceeded my prepayment by 4.92, and appeared to say this amount was charged to my card on departure. I hope and expect that no attempt is made to recover this amount. A prepaid room is fully prepaid if the hotels charges change between when the stay is prepaid and when the guests arrive, that is the hotels risk. After all, they had my money for nine months. It is not a charge that can legitimately be passed on to the customer.Bruxin,I appreciate you taking time to let us know about the issues you had with the hotel. I am very sorry about the confusion with the prepayment. We just switched out front desk system, and they have been working on it for about a week and a half! The system is not playing well with out credit card swipers causing declines, so we have new ones on order. I have refunded the 4.92 to your credit card. The city implemented a tourism assessment in April causing the difference in your bill. I do heartily apologize for the disappointment in our hotelMelissa AlbertGeneral Managermalbertstcharlesinn.net"},{"0":"Yellville","1":"29.926972","2":"-90.094341","3":"Best Western Plus St Charles Inn","4":"4","5":"Have stayed here twice, and definite improvements were made since the first time.

The hotel staff were super nice and efficient, especially Jeana at the front desk and Tatum in house keeping. The lobby is great with a very nice and plentiful breakfast, as well as snacks midday and coffee or lemon infused water all day! Our room was super clean and could not have been nicer, plus having two separate vanities/sinks really spoiled us. There was even a window in the bathroom for FRESH air. We found the French Quarters to be dirty and intimidating at times (so many homeless), so being in this area was another plus...surrounded by beautiful homes, trolley across the street, a few blocks from the Fresh Market grocery and the best bonus of all was the grassy park right next door which came in handy for those late night/early morning potty breaks for our dog. I am so glad that we were unable to find a pet friendly hotel WITH GRASS in the Quarters as we would have been so unhappy and absolutely loved our stay here, and this location for half the price also!! One more thing is parking...it was free and gated They gave us a remote control so we could come and go as we pleased knowing we would always have a free parking space waiting for us at the end of the day. Never saw a manager, but did not need to. Everything ran smooth and efficient.

You could sit outside on the small patio and watch the streetcar go by. Great place for people watching too. Excellent Tex-Mex restaurant next door. The hotel is small, so not so many people that you get lost in the crowd. Breakfast was outstanding. Lots of choices for a small hotel. It was also quiet. I particularly liked the reading library loan option on my floor (2nd) and enjoyed a John Grisham novel while I was staying there. There were only a few cons - my room was musty and seemed damp. The elevator was broken while I was there, but the hotel staff did offer to carry my bags up and down. I'm planning another trip to NOLA in the near future and will go back to see if things have improved a bit.Thank you for taking the time to review our property. I'm glad that you enjoyed the hotel despite the out-of-order elevator. I apologize that you were inconvenienced in any way. We would love to have another opportunity to provide you with superior service and hope that you will stay with us again the next time you plan a trip to New Orleans!Mollie Sciacca, Asst. General Manager"},{"0":"Port Lavaca","1":"29.926972","2":"-90.094341","3":"Best Western Plus St Charles Inn","4":"1","5":"The front desk staff was wonderful and as helpful as can be. This was especially true, when our room had mold on the windows and drapes and smelled of damp. We were immediately moved to the only other available room, which, unfortunately also had mold (this time in bathroom) and damp. It was supposed to be a more expensive room because it overlooked St Charles Street, which under cover of night seems to have lots of inebriated individuals and street pharmacists doing business. We couldn't use the elevator for a short time after the ceiling fell in on another guest and had to be repaired. The bed was comfortable and would have contributed to a good nights sleep except for the damp smell. Both the room we started with and the room we eventually slept in were a bit small for two twin beds and a family of four with teenagers.The staff made sure the rest of our four-night reservation was cancelled and let us keep our car in the secured parking lot while we explored the French Quarter the next day even after we had checked out. They were helpful despite our unpleasant stay due circumstances beyond their control. Because of the helpfulness and friendliness of the front desk staff, I wish that I could give this hotel a higher rating, but as we could not even stay past the first night of our reservation (and then only because it was late and dark and we had no other place to go), I could not recommend this hotel.David,I'm very sorry we did not exceed your expectations during your stay. The issues you encountered have been addressed by housekeeping. We have rooms with two double beds and one king bed. I'm sorry the room with two double beds seemed small for your family. I hope your time in New Orleans was enjoyable and you were able to see a lot while site-seeing after you checked out. We always want to accommodate our guests by letting them their cars with us a little longer!Again, I am very sorry you did not enjoy your stay. I hope you will consider staying with us again, so we can have a chance to provide you with excellent service.

I'm sure great for families of students attending SDSU, but not a place I'd really recommend if you want to come for even a short vacation in San Diego. However, the staff was friendly and accommodating, and the rooms were clean and maintained. Parking lot is on the small side and the breakfast area is really, really tight. Lots of construction happening in the area, making navigating the streets a bit more difficult. You need a car to get around, walking will get you to fast food places only. Overall, an OK place for a short stop.Dear Valued Guest, hank you for your review about your recent stay at our hotel. I was pleased that our staff made your stay a pleasurable one. They truly are a large part of why we rate so highly with our guests. I am sorry you were disappointed in our location. As you mentioned, we are an excellent choice for travelers visiting SDSU, one of Californias largest universities (1 mile), or Qualcomm Stadium (2 miles), but we are also close to major freeways that can get you to many attractions, usually under 15 minutes. Regarding restaurants in the area, the staff has a list of really excellent restaurants within a mile or so of the hotel. These are not big, fancy restaurants, but many of them are very nice, including Bridges Bar Grill, only a block away from the hotel. This is one area where our dedication to customer service really shows, we try to direct our guests to local places that we love ourselves.You mentioned the construction, it is true, our neighborhood is going through some major changes that we are very excited about. New commercial and housing buildings are sprouting up, they will bring new energy to our area.It is sometimes a challenge to set the right expectations for our guests. I think we do a pretty good job on our website, and the majority of our guests have written honest reviews about their experience with us, what makes us standout from the rest and why they rate us so highly on TripAdvisor. Our hotel is a modest AAA 2-diamond property, with amenities and prices that reflect that rating. We believe it is well located, friendly and very clean. We make sure that the grounds are lush and well kept, we never charge for parking, internet, breakfast or movies.We appreciate the time you took to review your stay with us.

Rooms are clean and the AC work well. There are a few things that take away a point: the parking is tight even with our family minivan. We got unexpected wake up call from some body car alarm goes off in the middle of the night right outside our room! and one night from the shampoo dispenser in the bath room came off the wall and crashed in the bath tub. It would be nice if they install a room safe and a small refrigerator.Hello FNguyen, Thank you for taking time to review us here on Trip Advisor. We work hard to keep our rooms and property ultra clean and well maintained, our staff consistently offers superior service to all our guests. Thank you for recognizing our efforts! We appreciate your honest remarks. We are so sorry you had a few odd incidents during your stay. Unfortunately, there are some things that we cannot control. Our parking lot can get a little tight, especially during sold out nights. Many guests with larger vehicles choose to park on the street for that reason. The area that we are in is generally a safe business/residential area and fortunately, we have not had any negative reports from people who have chosen to park on the street. We do warn guests that early Tuesday mornings, street sweeping takes place and tickets are given to anyone parked during those hours. As far as the shampoo dispensers go, we have found a solution to this problem and are currently taking care of it so that it does not continue to be an issue. Your two suggestions have been passed on to the GM for consideration. We value our guests input and are always working on improving our little hotel. Again, thank you for sharing your experience with us. We hope to serve you again in the future! * Book Direct with Us - For the Best Service, Selection, and Value! * Yours in Hospitality,Michelle C.

For the first time, Trip Advisor has let us down. I find it impossible to believe that the Lamplighter is the second-highest rated hotel in all of San Diego!It is not great value for the money it is simply an inexpensive motel, with nothing special or remarkable to recommend it. It is located on a busy street in a marginal neighborhood. The lush landscaping of the grounds consists of a few palm trees dotting the parking lot which makes up most of the site, and a patch of grass by the small pool (separated from the parking lot by only an iron fence). We booked a room with a kitchen because it happened to be the best rate available. The room was large in area, but so badly laid out and drearily decorated that it felt cramped and depressing (the kitchen was a total waste of space, especially since it wasn't stocked with cookware or dishes- the cupboards and drawers were completely empty). The furniture was ugly and drab. The room was not well sound-proofed each time our upstairs neighbors took a step, it sounded like elephants were marching across the ceiling. The bathroom was fortunately very clean, but the polyester-blend bath towels were thin and not very absorbent, and left a flurry of lint everywhere. The complimentary breakfast did feature a good selection of pastries, cereals, waffles, juices and fruit, but the pastries were stale and tasteless and the coffee (in styrofoam cups) was bad.The Lamplighter is by no means a dump or a dive it was clean, and the one staff member we dealt with on check-in and check-out was polite and efficient. But it does not by any stretch of the imagination deserve the inflated rating it now enjoys on TripAdvisor.Dear Valued Guest, Thank you for your review about your recent stay at our hotel. We appreciate hearing from all of our guests. These reviews show us not only our areas of strength, but also the areas in which we can improve. TripAdvisor measures only one thing, guest satisfaction. It is not a measure of luxury or location. On TripAdvisor, an economy hotel can score very well and a luxury hotel can score poorly. It is clearly displayed on TripAdvisor that our hotel class is a 2-star (were a AAA 2-diamond property), with amenities and prices that reflect that rating. There definitely are hundreds of luxurious hotels in San Diego to choose from, but at a much higher cost and possibly a lower level of guest satisfaction. Our rating on TripAdvisor is a byproduct of our single-minded dedication to consistent service, quality, and value. We are proud of the ambiance we have created with the space we have available to us. We definitely dont have the grounds that a larger hotel might have, but we have taken great effort to fill our space with colorful plants, flowers, vines, and many lovely palm trees. Its an expense many mid-market hotels arent willing to incur. Regarding your room, it is a kitchen layout that is very popular with many guests staying for long periods as they have full size appliances and plenty of counter space. While none of them are stocked, we do provide full kitchen packs upon request. We do this to protect our guests. We have learned from experience that by keeping the kits in a sealed container, we can ensure that when a new guest arrives, the kit they receive will be clean, complete and in good condition. Im sorry this was not explained to you. Our company culture is to provide outstanding customer service, quality and value to our guests. We manage two hotels in San Diego, we are proud that both are in the top 15 on TripAdvisor. Thank you again for your review. We do appreciate the comments.

From the time I made the reservation with Len Regan until I checked out early Monday morning, I was treated like a valued customer. Len upgraded me to a suite without any prompting on my part. He provided excellent, concise directions to public transportation as well as provided a coupon for a Trolley Tour of the city. The Lamplighter, while an older hotel, is very well maintained and super clean. It's third generation American family owned. The landscaping is lush, the breakfast is more than a continental and very tasty. The team spirit among the employees and staff was most noticeable. I observed an array of elderly folks who seem to be frequent guests and discovered many have been coming for two to three month stays for many years. There are good restaurants within walking distance.

Although it has a 'motel' look (two story buildings with outside doors) it is well maintained and has well kept grass, plants and flowers which give it a more friendly feel. There is a small but clean pool which is set up with beach chairs with towels on them for your convenience. There is a nice little breakfast set up (pastries, bagels, cereal and make your own waffles) served until 10am every morning. Its a great way to start the day and save a bit of money on food. We stayed in a suite which was very spacious (small sitting room with a pullout couch and then an attached room with a nice sided bed) and perfect for me, my husband and our young son (there's no door between the rooms - so don't look for privacy). One of the best features is Len - a member of staff at the hotel. He is very friendly, seems to know most everyone by their name and is a fount of information. We checked in daily with him for the scoop on things we were considering seeing. The only downside to the hotel is the location. Its not terrible - but its not a 'walking' friendly place. There are a lot of little local shops (drug stores, nail salons, that sort of thing) but nothing necessarily 'pretty' or tourist friendly places. That being said, it is very easy to get in a car and drive to many of main attractions of San Diego - and the staff is more than happy to give you driving information to them. Our original plan was to stay in Old Town (which after seeing we absolutely love!) but the hotels were sold out. If you're looking for a decent place to rest your head and are willing to hop in your car for short distances to get to places than I would recommend the Lamplighter."},{"0":"Green Valley","1":"32.766944","2":"-117.059777","3":"Best Western Lamplighter Inn Suites at SDSU","4":"5","5":"I stayed three nights and thought the staff went out of their way to anticipate my needs and make my stay comfortable. Not being familiar with San Diego, I appreciated the easy access to I-8 and the convenient location. Most importantly I felt safe, both in the motel and the surrounding area. Motel is two stories but I heard no noise from other rooms or outside and found my room quiet.I am an early riser and enjoyed getting my continental breakfast and free USA Today each morning and going out by the outdoor pool to sit. The area is nicely landscaped with lots of flowers and shrubs.The room was exceptionally clean and alrhough on the small side had everything I needed. I would definitely stay here again.Hello Joan W, Your 5 star review is greatly appreciated by our entire staff here at the Lamplighter Inn!

We stayed here for five nights with our two young children and visited the zoo, Balboa Park, Sea World and Coronado during our stay. The hotel was near the zoo/Balboa Park and was a reasonable distance from Sea World and the beach. El Cajon Blvd has many ethnic (Mexican, Thai, Vietnamese, Kosher) restaurants and the usual fast food chains. We did not see any restaurant chains such as Outback, Denny's, or Chili's near the hotel. There are several grocery and drug stores nearby. We felt safe walking around the neighborhood with our kids.Our room was clean with updated bedding and furniture and had a fridge and microwave. It was not large, but adequate for our needs. We did not have any problems with noisy neighbors or noise from the street during late-night hours. The free continental breakfast was good. The only thing I found missing was yogurt. We asked for advice and directions from the front desk several times and they never led us astray. We also purchased discount zoo tickets from the front desk. We used the pool once and it was fine.I agree with another reviewer that it is just a motel.

We spent 6 nights in this hotel, which we chose based on the reviews here, and were not very happy. I'll try to break in down to pros and cons:Pros:- It is a decent, well-maintained property. - Housekeeping was great, the room was very clean and the grounds are beautifully landscaped.- Breakfast was better than expected, had a wide selection and kept us (and kids) happy for the first half of the day.- Most of the staff we encountered was friendly and helpful, especially the front desk manager.Cons:- Location!! The hotel is located in a remote, not-so-good part of town (not a bad neighborhood, just a commercial street dotted with hookah lounges and pawn shops). Getting anywhere in the city took about 20 minutes drive and was quite frustrating.- The room, although spacious and comfy, does NOT contain fridge and/or microwave, which made it difficult to stay with kids.- They charge for cribs in the room - 5 per crib per night, which would add up to quite a hefty amount. We have been traveling with young kids for the past 6 years, and this is the first time we were charged for crib. On checkout, when the front desk lady asked if everything was ok, I said that I was unhappy with this extra charge - she just shrugged and said it was the manager's decision. Great.To sum it up: for families with young kids like ourselves, I'd suggest not to be tempted by the reasonable price and positive reviews, but rather pay more attention to the details and choose a hotel closer to downtown.Dear Valued Guest, Thank you for sharing your experience with the TripAdvisor community, and for choosing the Best Western Lamplighter Inn Suites. Thank you for mentioning what you enjoyed about your stay your compliments are appreciated. I am truly sorry that your experience was not what you had hoped. Our goal is to exceed every guests expectations, and we take it very seriously when we fail.Best Western Lamplighter Inn Suites is a AAA 2-diamond property. We tend to rate highly with those who appreciate great customer service, clean rooms and want the most for their dollar. While we do charge 5 for a crib, we also include many free amenities that you may end up having to pay for in more expensive hotels, including those in the downtown area. We offer free wireless internet, free parking, free coffee and tea all day, DVD players in all guestrooms, a thoughtfully selected free movie library, and a complimentary expanded continental breakfast that includes much more substance than a standard continental breakfast, we offer hard-boiled eggs, steel-cut oatmeal, freshly made bagels and pastries, juices and make-your-own-waffles. As you mentioned, the hotel property is very well maintained, with clean, lush, and beautifully landscaped grounds. The guestrooms are spotless, as well as spacious and comfy. We appreciate that you noticed this about our rooms. I apologize that a refrigerator was not included in your room type. We do have rooms equipped with microwaves and mini-fridges, as well as rooms with efficiency kitchens. Next time you stay, please feel free to ask for a room with a refrigerator or a full kitchen. I am truly sorry that our location was not convenient for you. We are about a mile away from San Diego State University, which is very convenient to a lot of our guests. Being close to the University, we are also in close proximity to many great restaurants and eclectic coffee shops. The freeways 8 and 15 are minutes away, so getting almost anywhere in San Diego takes less than 20 minutes. We are in a very central location, pretty much the middle of San Diego if you look at a map.Thank you again for choosing to stay at the Best Western Lamplighter Inn Suites, and for taking the time to write a review. We take guest satisfaction very seriously, and we are constantly trying to improve. Your feedback will help us do that.

It looked like they really tried to give a garden feel to it with hanging succulents and different plants all around. I arrived at 11, too early to check in but they let me park in their lot for the 15 (wish it were included),. The parking area is small but backing in helps. I have a Jeep Cherokee and had no problems. The room was small but clean and cute. I was there for a bachelorette party and fake diamond rings were hidden around the room, so I can attest to the cleanliness since 9 girls looked for rings in almost every inch of the room. One downside of the hotel was being woken up a couple different times by sirens and honking but it is the downtown area. Breakfast was very nice- pancakes, sausages, eggs, different breads and muffins, cereal, yogurt, granola, fruit, almond milk, teas and coffee. There was a waffle maker but I didn't see batter. The woman working in the breakfast area was very efficient and helpful. They had a nice little seating area outside and tables and seats outside some of the rooms. The hotel was walking distance to everything we did, maybe a 10 min walk. I would stay again.

The room was extremely clean, so much so that we had to keep the windows open to let the cleaning fragrance escape! I guess you should never complain about a place being too clean. The room included a complimentary hot breakfast but did not include parking. The hotel was a bit away from San Diegos centre but it was definitely within walking distance for us. If not for others, the trolley and bus stop is only a block away. The staff member at the front desk was very helpful with information regarding maps, transport, food and places to steer clear from. The nightly rate was 150USD, maybe a little pricey for what we got but we enjoyed the stay overall. We were there to see San Diego after all, not the four walls of the Best Western.

If there are any complaints at all about this hotel...it's probably from miserable people who hate their lives."},{"0":"Garland","1":"29.9623","2":"-90.0662","3":"Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel","4":"3","5":"This is a nice hotel. It is located in the back of the French Quarter so it's not too loud. Overall experience was nice. My only issue is the parking rate. There was no information regarding a parking fee during booking. Parking is 20-30 per day. I had to pay almost 100 just for parking, and was also billed 100 for incidental fees which is refunded after check out. Kind of a bummer on a trip where these were additional fees.Dear Shuwanda, I am glad you enjoyed our hotel during your stay. I apologize for the confusion on the hotel parking fee's. If you would like to further discuss please contact the hotel. Thank you for staying with us and we greatly appreciate it."},{"0":"Auckland Central","1":"29.9623","2":"-90.0662","3":"Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel","4":"4","5":"This small, almost boutique hotel on the boundary of the French Quarter offers a quiet respite from the hullabaloo of Bourbon Street, and the French Market just three blocks away. In the centre of the hotel is a shaded, landscaped courtyard with an al fresco dining area, and swimming pool. The rooms are clean,comfortable and roomy, with good amenities. The staff are very welcoming, friendly, and helpful with booking tours, and answering questions. Breakfast was varied and delicious. There is a welcoming bar and lounge, which is a great place to meet fellow travellers.Thank you Sue for taking the time to write such a detailed review about our property!

The most popular things to see were a 15-minute walk or a combination of streetcar rides. The staff was helpful, knowledgable, and friendly. No mis-steps there. Breakfast had eggs, meats, breads, potatoes, waffles and more. What are the negatives The rooms are dated and dark. The soft water combined with soap makes the shower floor a little slippery. Parking is not complimentary.Dear Fred, thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. We appreciate the kind words of breakfast, staff and location.

There are some amazing restaurants and music venues nearby and there are trips and tours available either from outside the hotel or from near the river.

The front desk was very helpful and breakfast was great. All in all a great experience and I would recommend this place to anyone.

The sights and activities were all within a short walk. Check in was quick, the staff at the front desk friendly and helpful with suggestions. The room itself, as noted by other reviews, is on the small side, but who cares, who is spending time in the room anyway! We were only there for one night. The breakfast has both hot and cold breakfast items, and while it was busy, the staff kept things well supplied. There is some construction going on in the street in front of the hotel, but that was not bothersome. I hate paying for parking, but it's a city--what are you going to do.... The parking area is kind of small, and the parking spots themselves are smallish. Dont' take a big car or truck!Thanks for choosing The Best Western Plus French Quarter the Hidden Gem.

It is far away from the party scene yet is easy walking distance to everything in the Quarter. It is not your typical hotel. Our room fronted the courtyard and was very nice for the rate we paid. The courtyard is quaint and relaxing. The breakfast is very good and has more of a restaurant feel and setup than your traditional hotel breakfast. The front desk staff was awesome and very informative. We only stayed one night, but are planning another week trip very soon.We are excited to hear that you will be back soon.

This was our first visit to New Orleans. We were welcomed by amazing jovial staff who were full of excellent suggestions for places to eat and visit. The best thing we did was leave our vehicle parked. (There is a daily cost for this.) We were able to walk to Jackson Square and explore the French quarter. What fun. Our room was clean and the air conditioning was quiet. Breakfast was plentiful and relaxing, a great way to start our day. We loved this older hotel and look forward to coming again.We are happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us on your recent trip to NOLA.

They took care of things for me before I even asked. The breakfast was good with eggs bacon or sausage, a waffle maker, yogurt muffins bagels Etc. The courtyard was nice although it was too cold to swim in the pool in November. Room was clean except for one day when a cleaner left a bag of towels in our room. The location was nice because it was just a few minute walk Into the heart of the French Quarter but far enough away to avoid the noise. Just across the street from Louis Armstrong Park which was also a beautiful place to be.I am pleased to hear you enjoyed our hotel and staff. You are right it was a bit chilly this weekend.

It was a good choice. The room was nice, with a fridge, and the hot breakfast was very good and filling, with eggs, waffles, bacon, sausage, etc. It was sort of at the beginning of the French Quarter, so it was not too loud, but it was easy to walk to Bourbon Street, Royal Street, etc. The staff was especially helpful. We only had two nights to stay, and were driving from natchez, so I called them on the way, and they booked us a city tour. The VIP tour was a great intro to the city, and booking it ahead like that saved us time and gave us something to do our first afternoon after arrival. All in all, this was a good trip and I would choose this hotel again."},{"0":"Houston","1":"29.9623","2":"-90.0662","3":"Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel","4":"4","5":"Good location, friendly staff, good breakfast. Room was clean and comfortable. Parking is atrocious. Be prepared to either double (or triple) park in their tiny lot, or park on the street. My real complaint is that, while I fully understand high season and high demand can drive up rates, this was not a 250 per night hotel. In any other circumstance this would be 100 less per night for a comparable hotel at another time/place. Thank you for your review on tripadvisor. It is from reviews from our guests that allow us to find areas that may need improvement. We are happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us on your recent trip. Our staff takes great pride in providing friendly service to our guests.The parking garage does present some challenges because of it's small size. Summer is a high drive time so this is when we have problems. We do double park cars to try to satisfy as many guests as possible as alternative parking is a few blocks away. As too our rates we are very well placed with hotels that are similar to ours.We hope that you would consider us again on your next trip to New Orleans.Robert K., Manager on Duty"},{"0":"Lake Stevens","1":"29.9623","2":"-90.0662","3":"Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel","4":"4","5":"This hotels is not in the middle of the action, but is close enough to walk to all and far enough away to enjoy the quiet when wanted.

The room was very clean. The free breakfast was delicious. It is a bit of a walk from Canal but you are saving hundreds. Just make sure you watch the parade in a spot where you can freely get to Rampert and are not barricaded in on the wrong side of the street. This is a clean sufficient hotel that will allow you to have money to spend on others things. You will be just fine walking down Rampert at night. Checkin was flawless. Thanks Best Western for the very good first impression."},{"0":"Manahawkin","1":"29.9623","2":"-90.0662","3":"Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel","4":"5","5":"On a recent business trip to New Orleans, I was able to extend my stay for an evening and in doing so, I chose to stay closer to the French Quarter (the host hotel was near the Superdome, about 1 mile away). The hotel structure itself dates to the 1800's as the very knowledgeable front desk clear explained when I inquired. She knew all the details and was very proud to share her knowledge. It certainly made for a very nice welcome at check-in (which was efficient and quick).After quickly settling in, I was off to explore the French Quarter and the hotel location on the edge of the historic district makes walking to everything quite easy, yet it's just far enough away from the nightlife to keep things quiet at night. Shops, restaurants, bars and historic sites are all around and across the street Louis Armstrong Park can be accessed a few blocks away.My room on the 2nd floor overlooked the lovely courtyard with trees, chairs to relax and an out door pool. The room was fresh and clean with comfortable beds, a pleasant bathroom with ample lighting, free Wi-Fi (easy to connect and fast speed), a refrigerator, HDTV and safe (large enough for my 14 laptop). The only item needing attention in my room was the grout in the shower, which must be a challenge in such a humid climate.Considering this is such a historic property, they have done a nice job connecting all the buildings and keeping the guest room modern yet with old world charm. Rooms face the courtyard, nearby buildings, the street - so be sure to request the view / area that most suits your needs.Although I did not take advantage of the pool, I did enjoy the complimentary breakfast in the morning. A nice mix of hot and cold options, including waffles, eggs, yogurt, cereal, etc. The staff were ever present and helpful to guests, a very positive experience. My only complaint was the oatmeal was only available using the instant packets, which is never as good as a nice hot crock often found at hotels today.In the evening, the hotel also opens the breakfast area for food and drinks, but I explored the area instead. The hotel lends itself to a relaxing escape, and I ended up meeting a couple who are regulars to the hotel and New Orleans! The best guest is a repeat one and that certainly speaks to the quality experience.While the focus appears to be leisure travelers, the hotel has everything required for a business traveler as well. If returning to New Orleans, I would certainly return again and would recommend to anyone looking for a clean, comfortable, affordable hotel with nice amenities. For meeting all my needs and the expectations of a Best Western Plus hotel, I would certainly rate my experience 5 stars.We are glad that we were able to be a nice break from your business trip and hope to see you again the next time you are in New Orleans.Thank You, Bryant Faul - General Manager"},{"0":"Downey","1":"29.9623","2":"-90.0662","3":"Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel","4":"4","5":"We enjoyed our stay at the Best Western Plus Landmark Hotel.

The staff is friendly and courteous. Check-in was easy and our room was clean and comfortable. The first night there were some loud party animals next door shouting drunkenly into the wee hours. After I called the front desk and complained, the noise died down and they weren't a problem any other night. We slept well and we had everything we needed.Breakfast was varied and plentiful. This is not a gourmet meal but it is good food (eggs, bacon, waffles, oatmeal, fruit, muffins, etc.) and we enjoyed eating by the pool in the courtyard. Very pleasant.The hotel is conveniently located at the edge of the French Quarter...away from the noise but a pleasant walk to the interior and minutes from everything. Honestly, we felt lucky to find this place. It isn't fancy, but it is very clean and fit our needs. The hotel staff answered questions and were very gracious. Check-out was easy and they held our bags. We were very happy with the location and value. The only other snafu we had was one afternoon we got back about 5:00 and they hadn't cleaned our room. Somehow the maid had skipped ours, but when we asked her to take care of it she did right away.

Quick taxi/Uber service from hotel to anywhere you want to go. Breakfast was hot, and plentiful. Staff kept tables cleaned quickly for more guests to dine. Rooms were clean and big enough for three adults to not feel cramped at all. Bartender Ty was fun and made one heck of a Bloody Mary... and we will remember his meat pie next time we visit!

You would have thought I would have gotten what I asked for (2 rooms side by side). When we arrived we were told we would not be on the same floor as someone who had just fronted at reception was given one of our rooms. I protested and they relented but our rooms were not side by side but quite a distance from each other. This was not good enough. The rooms themselves were nice and the hotel very good. Did have a problem with other guests walking past our door in the early morning and talking rather loudly - enough to wake us up. Also the car park directly underneath the rooms was not good. Motorbikes revving early morning is bad. Good to have computers available to guests. Breakfast was a definite bonus, with alot of variation.

I mean how long are you going to be in the room anyway The rooms were not huge, but they were clean and the beds were very comfortable. This is an old restored building which has lots of charm. The elevators are tiny and there is a nice courtyard with a pool and seating areas. (we were there in the winter) They offer a free continental breakfast, including eggs, sausage, biscuits and more. The bartender was friendly and very helpful with local attractions. They have free WI-FI and a small business center that makes it handy to print your boarding passes. The hotel is just a few blocks from Bourbon Street, and is far enough that you don't have to listen to all the noise. They do have an airport shuttle, BUT you must reserve it at least 24 hours in advance. If only the front desk had told us this little detail, we could have saved some money.

It's located on the edge of the French Quarter, so you can be in the action on Bourbon Street after a five minute walk. And when it's time to come home, you can get away from the action to relax in the peace and quiet of your hotel room. We were delighted to get upgraded to a suite, but really did not spend much time in the room taking advantage of the hot tub or other amenities. There is so much to see and do in town and the tour buses will pick up visitors right at the front door of the hotel. A nice bar is available for a leisurely drink and a free breakfast is offered featuring a variety of the usual fare. Parking is hard to come by in town, but it's available on site for hotel guests (for a nightly fee).

The room appeared to be recently renovated and finishes were good. Lovely full size tiled shower (no bath). Our room was on the U-shaped surround of the courtyard, which was lovely and full of greenery, a fountain, pool and several shaded tables.The breakfast was disappointing with low-end standard fare. But the service in all areas of the hotel was excellent. It's at the upper edge of the French Quarter and everything was easily walkable. The added bonus was the opportunity to see more of the lovely architecture. This is a great place to visit with a group of friends/family. The courtyard affords the opportunity to gather and socialize without everyone piling in a room or hanging in the lobby (both awkward options!).

People were very nice...loved it"},{"0":"Manteca","1":"29.9623","2":"-90.0662","3":"Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel","4":"4","5":"We had a good stay. The location is a little bit away from the French Quarter. I would have liked to be just a little closer for safe walking, but we were fine . There are always taxi cabs right outside. The pool was nice and refreshing . A nice courtyard to sit at. The breakfast was good. It was clean. A little dreary but good for the price and location. Inside parking for a price 21 dollars . Limited though , on a first come basis . No microwave in room , but one in lobby to use. Frig in room and a coffee pot . Bar in the lobby. Good air conditioning!

When we explained the management that we needed to stay on a budget as low as possible, preferring to share one room instead of booking two, they deliberately misunderstood us, charging us the room rate for two instead of one. We immediatly realized the mistake and asked to rectify it. The management was then totally unhelpful, refused to rectify and called the police. The police sided with the management, which should not even have been an issue at all right from the start. Any serious and well-led hotel should allow the customers to rectify a booking, particularly since we hadn't even entered the rooms. Do not stay there if you are looking for an honest management and good service!!"},{"0":"Naples","1":"29.9623","2":"-90.0662","3":"Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel","4":"4","5":"Close to the French Quarter without the noise.

Needs a microwave to keep the family happy. Thank you Guest for taking the time to review our hotel. We appreciate all the great comments to help our future guests know our prime location. Having on-site parking does help our guests with convenience and our pool and courtyard are a great place to sit back and relax after a long day of touring.

When going up to my room I was put in the back facing the below parking and not over the garden that all the pictures show so I was a little disappointed right from the start. When walking into the room it was terribly small. The mirror and sink are not even it the bathroom and the actual bathroom just closes with a sliding closet door. The shower itself was nice. Walk in and glass doors. The beds were rock hard and the pillows were just small throw pillows. Other than the location the other part I liked was the garden and swim area. I did not swim as the pool was full of leaves and such. I had seen an employee put a self cleaner in the pool but it still didnt seem as clean as I would have thought it to be. The staff always said hello when walking past but they didnt seem very happy. Overall I dont think I would stay here again.Ms BrittanyThank you for accenting our unique location, we are glad you found getting around the French Quarter convenient.I hope you change your mind about returning to our hotel, please keep my email and phone number below so I can do everything possible to assist in reserving the area of the hotel which makes you most comfortable.

Efficient check-in by staff but had to wait for room as it was not ready. This was no problem for us at all. We had just missed breakfast but tea and coffee was on tap all day at no extra cost which was a nice touch. When our room was ready (we were in the main block) we were pleasantly surprised how roomy it was with king sized bed, fridge, iron and ironing board and good bathroom with bath tub. It overlooked the lovely courtyard and pool area. The hotel didn't do lunch or dinner but staff were very helpful in suggesting a deli for lunch, where you could bring your sandwich back and eat in the breakfast area, and were helpful in suggesting where to eat for dinner. Bourbon Street was only a few blocks away which was very convenient. All in all, very attentive staff, good accommodation, excellent location, lovely courtyard with pool (although it was too cold to use it when we were there). Free wfi with small buriness centre. I have no hesitation in recommending this hotel.Thank you for choosing The Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel for your stay in New Orleans.

The safe was not accessible so our passports and valuables were left unsecured. Having left the door open we would have thought they would have been in there replacing towels or making beds but neither of those things were done.

The staff throughout was amazing. The hotel is located in a old building but then again it is at the tip of the french quarter so that should be expected. The room I stayed in was really large with a comfortable king bed, eating table, office desk and chair, credenza and couch. It was outdated in its style but for the price and location, and short stays, this is a really great deal. The bathroom needs to be bleached down but there were more than enough clean towels and counter space with a small coffee maker for the supplied coffee and tea. They also have complimentary continental breakfast. It was too cold to use the terrace but it would be the perfect place for morning coffee and beignets. The location results in a quieter sleep but verify your surroundings before venturing."},{"0":"Saint Louis","1":"29.9623","2":"-90.0662","3":"Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel","4":"5","5":"We stayed at this hotel for four nights on our honeymoon. We had a King suite with Jacuzzi tub, internet included, microwave and refrigerator. We got a great deal and the room was beautiful. The hotel property is well maintained and inviting and the staff is friendly and helpful. The courtyard/pool are lovely.The location was perfect for us. It is only three block from Bourbon Street and the entire French Quarter and Garden District are both within walking distance. The breakfast was great! Sometimes when you hear continental breakfast you think stake doughnuts and bad fruit - this was not the case here. Each day had eggs, breakfast meat and bread or potatoes. In addition fruit, yogurt, toast, bagels, waffles, coffee, juices and water were available. We liked to start our day with breakfast at the hotel while we reviewed our plan for the day. It also helped cut down on our food costs.My only suggestion - if you have a room on the first floor bring a fan.

The staff was nothing but exceptional the entire time, the room clean, comfortable and modern, and the breakfast the best I've ever had in a hotel. I would have liked a little more fresh fruit, but the market isn't far so that wasn't a huge deal. We actually added on another day and night because we were having such a wonderful time! It's location is perfect as well, just far enough away to be quiet but close enough that a short walk puts you right in the action of the French Quarter. The only drawback was that our car was hit in the parking lot, and we didn't notice until we had stopped on our way out, so perhaps next time we'll park elsewhere.

Rooms are small if your tall you may want to avoid the bathroom, the water pressure is really low and the water is kind of slimy sticks with your skin after your dry. I've stayed at other Hotels in NOLA and can't blame the water source. Parking is a bit cramped if you drive a SUV or Truck be careful. Breakfast is good for being FREE but I would rather eat at many of the great restaurants...courtyard area is nice as is the bar. they also have no security and the rooms doors face out anyone can't just walk in and out on this property. The street where the hotel sits is under major construction so lobby and bar are covered in dust. Staff of the hotel were good allowed me to check in early. Like I said Hotel was decent would not however be my first choice more of a back up plan.Thank you for choosing our hotel for your stay here in New Orleans. We need honest reviews from guest's like you in order to correct our shortcomings. The construction should be finished in late summer or early fall of this year. This streetcar line will be a great plus for this part of the French Quarter. Our water goes through a water softener which will make it feel like it is still on you after you have rinsed. We do close our gates at 11:30 each night and have a Security Officer on premises every night with only one door unlocked to access the hotel. We sure wish we could make our parking lot bigger.

It has a nice pool located in the centre of the forecourt with plenty of loungers and tables around it. The inclusive breakfast was good and plentiful but ends at 9.30am on a weekday with extended times on the weekend. Rooms are clean and comfortable but as is fairly common now, A/C units are located in the rooms and can get very noisy at night.

We had a courtyard room and barely had enough space for our luggage (forget about using it for 4 people). The obvious place for bags is either in front of the door (blocking it) or in between the beds. There's hardly room for your toiletries and you have to remove them if you want to make coffee. Also, the a/c is half a foot from a bed, so you have a constant cold flow over your bed.That said, the location is really good: you're just blocks away from all the fun in Bourbon Street there's a streetcar in front of the building and you are only steps away from the Armstrong park.

We decided last minute to drive to the concert because of weather concerns. The concert did not end until late and when we returned to the hotel the gate was shut at the entrance. My wife ran in and asked the clerk who came out promptly and opend the gate. The parking was a little tight especially since I drive a large SUV but amazingly I had no problems parking.

We have stayed at the Landmark Hotel before in a quiet room facing the courtyard, which is a must when booking at this hotel, but this visit the room was next to the elevator, this is why I only gave 4 stars for this stay, otherwise it would have been 5 stars. The noise of the elevator from 11:30pm to 2:30am continuously woke us up, so when booking a room ask for a room facing the courtyard but not next to the elevator! The hotel was is just a few blocks from Bourbon St. and a nice walk to Jefferson Square and the French Market. One of the Hop-On-Hop-Off bus stops is just a few blocks from the hotel on Rampart, very convenient! The Hotel is right across the street from Louis Armstrong Park which has a very nice park which I highly recommend to take a stroll in during the day.I am pleased to hear you enjoyed our hotel and staff.

The staff was warm and friendly. When they found out we were there to celebrate a special occasion my 50 Birthday they went out of there way to make me feel special. The location of the room overlooked the pool and garden. The room was beautiful, well decorated. The bed was very conferable. I believe the sheets were even a high thread count . I liked the fact that is was only 3 blocks from the excitement Bourbon Street. This made it very convenient for walking. Plan on walking everyplace. There is lots to do and see. Defiantly walk to Cafe Dumont for Cafe Au Lait and a Beignets are a must. Walk along the fresh market for some fine shopping and walk along the Mighty Mississippi and look out over the water. The hotel is close enough to get to the action but far enough away that when it is time to sleep you don't have to deal with the noise. The hotel courtyard and fountain with a nice pool is a great place to be outdoors. Continental breakfast had a great variety of choices including eggs, and a pleasant dining room overlooking the courtyard and pool. Before you leave you must stop by Clover Grill on 900 Bourbon Street for the worlds best breakfast you will ever eat. If you are going to New Orleans and need a place to stay don't hesitate choose this hotel you won't regret it."},{"0":"Blaricum","1":"29.9623","2":"-90.0662","3":"Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel","4":"4","5":"We stayed here 2 nights in november of 2012. The hotell is close to the city centre. Very nice people at the check in. Breakfast was really good, you can make your own fresh waffle's. We enjoyed those 2 nights here.Thank you for your review from 2012. We currently offer the fresh waffle makers and we now have access across the street to take the streetcar to all of the other parts of the city outside the French Quarter including the beautiful Garden District and City Park.

The room was more than adequate except for the fact that my room overlooked Rampart Street so you had a bit of noise of vechiles on the street at night. The hot breakfast was good, eggs, a different meat everyday, waffles etc..A lot of channels on the TV to chose from, we did have a washout day with 7 inches of rain so staying in the room was more pleasant and free WIFI. One thing that is overlooked by even the hotel is their location across the street from Congo Park now named Louie Armstrong Park, what a beautiful historic, clean large sidewalked area to find peace and tranquility, my wife and I spent a few hours just walking and feeding the ducks in the numerous ponds in the park. It was practically empty of people on a beautiful sun drenched afternoon in Spring Staff was also top shelve probably the nicest BW I have stayed at...I recommend it highly."},{"0":"Warsaw","1":"29.9623","2":"-90.0662","3":"Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel","4":"5","5":"The location, just on the verge of French Quarter with 5-minute walk to its center sells this htel easily.

The price is OK for New Orleans and this location, though you have to pay additionally for th parking. Overall I had a great experience.Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel.

Excellent location. The hotel itself has a peculiar odor throughout - especially in the elevators. I would imagine it was because of the intense humidity outdoors but I'm not sure. The elevators are tiny. Rooms are a decent size. Shower has a rain shower head which is not my favourite but that's just personal preference. Breakfast is typical of free Breakfast hotels. Hot and cold options. I would stay here again for the location.Thank you for your excellent review.The humidity is certainly a factor in everything we do, and can be different. It does take some getting used to, but spending time in New Orleans is worth it!!We are a unique property in a unique location and our goal is to by anything but typical!

Had researched this hotel and checked other trip advisor postings and appeared to be a reasonable choice......unfortunately this was not the case. I am a huge fan of Best Westerns in general and have stayed in BWs in Australia, New Zealand and North America, this one by far is inferior. To call it a plus just because it has internet a pool and breakfast is a long shot. Let me give you a brief rundown. The hotel is a 10-15 min cab ride from the airport, there is a shuttle from the airport for 38 pp (all ages) return from your hotel, but a cab for up to 3 passengers was a flat rate of 14 pp one way, there were 3 of us so we cabbed it. Check in was ok, no worries, we had a room on the 2nd floor overlooking the pool....big mistake.....TV wasnt working, reported it to front desk the first day, they forgot, after a sleepless night listening to people come and go at all hours right outside our room and walking back and forwards along the balcony we mentioned it to the front desk and 2 young men were very helpful, one was Lawrentey and the other I cannot remember his name..we mentioned TV not working and no light globe in our bathroom light, but the person who was going to fix it had left so they gave us another room, next door....at least the light worked and the TV.......5 out of 6 nights were noisy noisy noisy, security is apparently on site 10pm-7am but I suspect who ever it was had gone home with the maintenance person as well, never saw them, never heard them....spoke to the front desk and it would appear they may just be one of the many ghosts in the French Quarter. We had 2x double beds and they were hard and air con noisy but at least it worked as it was wonderfully hot during our stay. Bathroom is small, there is a safe and TV is OK. Breakfast is 630-930am, standard BW fare, breakfast meats rotate, that is one day sausage, one day bacon, toast, cereal, bagels, mini muffins, scrambled eggs (powdered) yoghurt, some fruit from a tin and make your own waffles. If you like apple jelly then this is apple jelly heaven.....not much else, it was a rare find indeed to find grape or even strawberry jelly! Juice and coffee is also there as well. Hotel is right at the top end of the French Quarter, close enough to walk to the French quarter, the river front, the french outdoor market and even Harrah's and the outlet shops are only a 20 min walk. Across the road is Louis Armstrong Park, we would go across every morning to feed the ducks, dodge the squirrels and try to avoid the small population of homeless people......still a sad thing to see in 2014! The hop on hop off bus is just a 7 min walk from the hotel, through the park and you can catch it at the info center which is a converted train station and right next door is a cemetery where you can walk around and get a feel for the history, this is where the New Orleans Voodoo Queen Marie Laveau is resting. The hotel has a lounge, sometimes it is open sometimes not.......ice machine on floors 2 and 3, thats it and a crappy vending machine with some coke products in the parking garage. Pool area is nice in the court yard with lots of tables, chairs and lounges. Checkout was a challenge but we got through it, we were honest when she asked how was you stay......didnt appear she wanted to hear what we had to say......here's a tip if you dont want to know the answer dont ask the question!...my advice, you can probably do better....if not try a room away from the pool area.......our 10 year enjoyed the pool and breakfast was ok, internet was ok and overall just an average experience....but New Orleans.....well that a whole other story!"},{"0":"Pasadena","1":"29.9623","2":"-90.0662","3":"Best Western Plus French Quarter Landmark Hotel","4":"5","5":"Stayed here for 3 nights-3 rooms....rooms were very clean and comfortable...We did have some issues with our reservation,the problem was taken care of very quickly by the staff.

This hotel is on a hillside, so if you can't handle doing stairs, then this may not be the place for you. However, the hillside affords nice vistas of San Diego. Great to have a margarita in the restaraunt and look down on Old Town. Weekends can be noisy due to party crowd in Old Town, but week days are quiet.Thank you for leaving impressions of your stay.

With Best Western, I only expect a place to sleep and shower. This hotel is a notch above other Best Westerns. We were helped by Dean at the front desk and he made us feel welcomed and answered all our questions. We appreciated the friendly check-in experience as we came from a hotel where front desk staff was rude and made us feel like an interruption. As a BW Gold member, we were also upgraded to a room with a nice view. The Spanish Hacienda architecture is charming and room furnishings were nice. Of course this is an older property and there is some wear and tear. You should consider staying here if you can get a rate 125. The location is perfect. You are right across the street from Mormon Battalion Historic Site and they run an awesome tour I'm not affiliated with LDS and they did not try to proselytize. There are numerous lively mexican restaurants in teh neighborhood and this was the perfect location to stay.Thank you for choosing to stay with us and your loyalty to Best Western. Your feedback is important and we really appreciate you drawing attention to the service you received from Dean while checking in. We want you (and all guests) to feel like a very important guest while you are here and that starts with warm responsive service.

The hotel changed the room to top floor but could not put us in a city view room, had one overlooking the road at the back which could be noisy at times. We were asked if we wanted to park on the road as they were full, so presume they were struggling with garage space. It was safe and saved 19 a day.The room itself was clean and large with two queen beds, table and two chairs, settee and table, fridge, safe, coffee maker, ironing facilities. The bathroom is looking old, the plug didn't stay in the bath, on the last day the sliding door was pushed back that far by the cleaning lady we couldn't get it out and the air con is very loud. Could also hearing the plumbing from adjoining rooms.The layout of the hotel is interesting as it is built on a hillside, not for people with walking difficulties. The grounds are beautiful. There is a pool with loungers, but for the size of the hotel is small.The location of Old Town is great, with plenty to see and restaurants and bars to walk to.All the staff we met were very niceJust a shame we didn't get our view as it has spoilt our previous memories.Thank you for your loyalty to Best Western Plus Hacienda Hotel Old Town. While its nice to hear you enjoyed your stay for the most part, Im so sorry we werent able to assign you to the room you desired. As Im sure you already know, there are many factors that go into room assignment such a room style, length of stay and previous guest check-out time. I hope youll give us another opportunity the next time you visit San Diego! Feel free to give my office a call so we can make sure you have the room you want. Booking direct will also guarantee the best reservation conditions. Thank you again for reaching out and leaving helpful feedback. I look forward to hearing from you. Enjoy your summer travels!

The reason that I didn't give this Best Western a better rating is because I've stayed at much nicer ones and there is an expectation on the Plus....but I did waffle between Aver. and Very Good. I think you can't go wrong for the location, but with that being said, the hotel is built on a hill and if you're looking for convenience in parking...be advised....yes, there's parking for an extra 15 and if the lot is full, well, be prepared to do street parking on a very steep hill and do some walking. There is valet parking for more , but after the price of the room, I didn't want to add to my bill. I didn't really mind the street parking b/c I ended up being lucky to be closer to the upper entrance...and, I'm fit and up for a little exercise, but if you're not, be prepared for that! Speaking of hills, being in the very upper part of the hotel there's a lot of outside stairs (that were beautiful in the setting), and there is a elevator, but can be a bit confusing finding your way by walking back down to the lobby. The entire hotel is broken up into different buildings, so I really don't know what the bottom part is like, but the upper blding room seemed nice when first walking in - they did a good job in decor, but to be honest (and why I didn't give it a better rating) it was pretty shabby - bathroom especially and the visual made it feel not so clean (I was one step away from laying down towels to make a pathway) and for 246.21 for a night there, I did expect a little better. I do realize it's in a prime location and that must be the rub! The lobby was very nice and I can't speak to the rooms lower down, but in peanut heaven, I think they need an upgrade! The morning coffee in the lobby wasn't anything special - it's the standard fare - fake creamers no raw sugar packets!It's such a great location...close to Coronado Island and especially to the airport if you have an early flight! It was perfect after a week at family wedding to end up there the day before flying out, was perfect! So, maybe it was very good, but I'm still giving it an average rating for the price!Thank you for your review and recommendations! Please come and see us again. We designed the decor and garden setting to match the vintage California style of Old Town. I am pleased to know there were many areas you found satisfaction in. We hope you will stay again. Please give us a call direct to get the best rates and reservation conditions. We can also work towards fulfilling any personal preferences with regards to room style and location.

On arrival we found that what we had booked was not available. We had booked a king suite for 2 nights and they had us down for 2queen beds for only one night, after some discussion with the front desk a second night was arranged in the same room. Each evening on our return to the hotel we found that our key cards did not work, normally this is not a big deal but this hotel is not like others we have stayed at we're all of the rooms are in the same building. The rooms in this hotel are all in different buildings so a lot of walking is required. Our room was in building 400 facing the rear of a restaurant and each morning we were woke by garbage trucks around 5am. On our last evening there we tried several vending machines to get a bottle of Pepsi but all were out of service , so we went to the fron desk to ask if there was any way to get a bottle and we were told to drive to a store somewhere ourselves to pick it up. The person on the desk was very rude about it. All in all the location was great but the service and the noise outside are room was terribl. On our last morning at breakfast all of the dishes were dirty.We are disheartened to read your review. I'd like to apologize on behalf of our staff for any inconveniences you encountered while with us. It is disappointing that your experience did not reflect our usual high standards and we understand your frustration. It is constructive feedback, such as yours, that really help us get a clear perspective of the areas we need to improve.

The room itself was a bit tired but we were expecting this having seen photos. The air con was powerful but noisy. The pool was small but good for a city hotel and never too busy (we used it a fair amount). The hotel is huge though so I feel they were not at full occupancy. Location was excellent- just across the road from the old town. It was also a 10 minute walk from the trolley/ tram system which easily could take you to the centre of town, 5 for a day pass. We arrived at 10am and they were able to give us a room at midday which was nice. We were in block 8 which was just above the carpark. While convenient, most of the other blocks were in much nicer locations, some rooms with views. I dont know if they were different price as Im sure we had the cheapest option. At check in we were given some 20 off vouchers for the hotel restaurant and a free drink voucher which we used once and was quite nice.Thank you for taking the time to sharing your experience with us!Sounds like you had a great summer getaway.

I had visited the city 17 years prior and remembered it being beautiful, but I never made it to Old Town. My one goal for the couple of days we had there was to enjoy some Mexican Food. Well, did we come to the right place or what. The Best Western is situated on the side of the hill with a view of the city and the Pacific. It is like a maze and due to low season there were not a lot of people on the property. It felt like we had the place to ourselves. There is a heated pool and a hot tub which are lovely especially at night. We had two amazing experiences regarding the restaurant Acapulco when we were there. Our first night we arrived after a long day of traveling and we were exhausted and starving. It said in our room book that the restaurant closed at 10pm. I looked at the clock and it was 10:01. I called to ask if there was any chance of getting food. They brought us a HUGE platter of amazing Mexican food and a 6-pack and the total was only 70!!! I was so happy. The next morning for breakfast we went to Acapulco again and were greeted by the very friendly staff. The table next to us had a coupon which they couldn't use for some reason so after they left the waitress applied the coupon to our bill without our knowledge and saved us over 20.00 We were blown away. The room was huge and fit our group of 5 comfortably. The lobby was beautifully decorated for Christmas and they even gave my daughter a lovely Christmas gift from under the tree. It is a one minute walk to the main drag in old town and two minutes to a lovely park up the hill. Also the hotel is very close to the transit system and the State park (which is really cool).Thank you for brining attention to the warm responsive service you received while staying with us. Indeed, Old Town boasts some of the best Mexican fare in all of San Diego. Acapulco is a great choice for any meal we are grateful to have them right on our property.

The service desk staff was friendly enough, but we did have to wait more than an hour for the shuttle to arrive at the airport for the 10-minute drive to the hotel. Being upfront about the delay could have let us call Uber to shorten our 13-hour travel day. The facility was clean enough, but a bit dated in style. There was some language miscommunication with the cleaning staff, but my fault for not running it through the front desk. The property is built on a multi-level terraced hill with multiple steps, patios, and elevators, so double-check your room location if you have concerns about walking any distance. We were about as far from the front desk as possible and had trouble remembering our route the first day. LOLThe free breakfast buffet was a nice surprise, with many options and good service.Thank you for your feedback. I am glad you found the hotels location convenient, your room clean and the staff friendly. Well pass your shuttle comments to the team to take a look at our efficiency levels. Normally, we dont have a problem with timing. Regarding your comment about steps to your room, I want to apologize for any inconvenience this caused. Six of our eight buildings do have elevators but because we are spread out on a hillside, there are also stairs. Please note that our staff is available 24 hours a day to assist with your needs and help you make the most of your stay.

Loved the location next to Old Town and the fact once we parked we never had to use our car until check out. A huge plus for my travel party. The shuttle driver was so nice and courteous and punctual. the room was ok as our room view was not what we desired.. I wanted a view of the city/ or bay, instead it was inside the courtyard. But beds and and room was decent. Breakfast was good served at the restaurant, that had a variety of offerings for all. The complaint I have was the Hot Tub, which was luke warm. We were very disappointed at the lack of heat of the spa. That was supposed to be relaxing and refreshing, instead it was like murky coldish bath water. I so wanted to love the hotel for future stays...Greetings, and thank you for your feedback. Im glad to hear that you found our location convenient, room comfortable and shuttle driver friendly. My apologies for the hot tub. Were looking into what might have been the problem! Before your next visit, please call the front desk directly to explore all room location options.

Check-in and check-out was quick and easy!Beds were clean and comfortable. I was disappointed for the price paid that there was no breakfast included, and when we happened to eat breakfast at the restaurant there is was less than adequate. Our breakfast order, which we put out on our door, was not picked up at night so we had the surprise of no breakfast in the room the next morning, but the clerk in reception comped our meal as a result, which was the right thing to do.Thank you for sharing your experiences while with us. Your feedback regarding the mistake we made on your breakfast order is invaluable. I am thankful our leadership team did the right thing, and comped your meal.

It is within walking distance to all the restaurants and shops, the property is beautiful and well maintained with vibrant floral landscaping, tile stairways and wonderful seating areas. It is a bit of a maze, but this makes the property very fun to explore and if you are stair adverse you can easily navigate the property by elevator. We stayed in building 6 in room 641 top floor at the end of the building, nice size room. The room was dated but the bed was comfortable. Microwave, refrigerator and coffee maker are nice amenities. There was a sitting area with a chair and a small, uncomfortable couch. The carpet at minimum could use a good cleaning, but the rooms really need updating. If you only plan on using the room to crash after a great day of sightseeing this hotel is perfect."},{"0":"Irvine","1":"32.7532","2":"-117.1944","3":"Best Western Plus Hacienda Hotel Old Town","4":"5","5":"Great experience.

This front desk lady explained that we needed to wait a little longer for our room but gave us a parking voucher for our car drink coupons. We didn't mind, as it seemed there was plenty to walk around do while waiting. My birthday was the next day on July 4th our reservation was for 3 nights. I was using BWR points that I'd saved for 3 years, as I am also a Best Western employee in another town. Later at check in, a different front desk lady issued our room keys, but had us scheduled for only 1 day, (checking out 7/4/14). After I questioned her, she fixed it in the system, but did not fix my keys, even though I asked her if my keys were ok, she assured me they were. She seemed like a new employee, but said I was good to go. She did not explain that breakfast was NOT included in our stay, nor did she mention a 14 fee for the parking voucher per day. We did know about the 20 per night pet fee. We went to breakfast the next morning, July 4th, and had to pay for it. That's how we found out about the breakfast vouchers. So upon returning to our room later that morning, we were locked out! My husband was upset, so I took the long walk down to the lobby to fix it. The front desk lady was very nice fixed my keys then gave me 2 breakfast vouchers for the next day 2 more drink coupons for our trouble, and cuz it was my birthday. We ended up giving our 6 drink vouchers to a couple in the bar it made their day! Later that afternoon I ran into Douglas Frost, a Front Desk Manager. He liked my puppy Gizmo. I told him it was my birthday explained that I work for Best Western. It was a pleasure talking to him. He was genuinely concerned that we were locked out and not informed of the rules regulations of his hotel upon checking in. He said he would look into it and get back to me. He must have got busy, as I never did hear back from him. However, at check out my parking pet fees were wiped off my credit card. We did use 1 breakfast voucher on Sat another on Sun. My husband doesn't eat breakfast, but we both got to have coffee at the restaurant both days. Nancy cleaned our room that afternoon, minutes after we asked. Thank you for that. A huge Thank you to Hector the bartender for a birthday flan bowl equipped with a lit candle. The Mariachi guys sang Happy Birthday in Spanish English to me. They didn't know my name so they called me Miss America! It was really cute. Upon leaving for the fireworks show at the beach, I slipped on the curb outside the Tequila Facory, cutting my ankle foot in 4 places. The beach was beautiful, however there were no restaurants available, no restrooms available barely anywhere to stand, sit or walk. The fireworks were Spectacular! Found out the next morning that there were over 1/2 million people at the beach for the show It took us 3 hours to get back to our hotel by trolly. Overall, I appreciated the friendly personalities of TRUE Best Western Family Employees. It's easy to see that Best Western cares about their guests, regardless the circumstances. Thank you for a great time.Happy Birthday and thank you for staying with us!

Located right in the heart of Old Town San Diego, there are great Mexican restaurants and shopping right outside your door. Unfortunately, the location is the only thing I would rate as Excellent.The rooms were a bit out of date, they could definitely use some updates, especially in the decor-area. The rooms were very, very dark. Not what I would expect in sunny San Diego.I believe my room was especially noisy. I stayed in the 700 building which backs up to the restaurants on the main street. Every morning at 5:30, the garbage truck would back up outside my window and unload the dumpster. Even on Sundays. I also had an adjoining room to a family of four. I could hear every single thing through the door between our rooms, including bathroom noises (not to be too graphic...)We also booked our rooms with the El Presidente package. It entitled us to a free breakfast and free dinner (with two free drinks). The breakfast was decent, especially the days when they had French Toast which was really good. The dinners were okay, with a very limited menu. We chose to eat in town quite a few nights and pass up the free dinners. Strangely, being a part of the El Presidente package also seemed to limit where you were allowed to sit in the restaurant. It would have been nice to eat outside.Overall, I think the hotel is a good value. The location is great and within walking distance of a lot of great sites. I probably would not recommend the hotel if you planned on staying indoors all day!"},{"0":"Silverton","1":"32.7532","2":"-117.1944","3":"Best Western Plus Hacienda Hotel Old Town","4":"4","5":"We stayed for 2 nights. Only issue, the TV was over 20 feet away from place to sit and watch. As two women traveling alone we felt very safe here. The hotel is one block from Old Town and looks out over most of the area. Nicely decorated and landscaped. Pool and hot tub were nice but I would make sure your room was not over that area.

However i can't justify the price of the hotel. Price should be way less , i know its san diego but still. I know the price spikes up during the summer but its still way too much. I went for business and leisure both very expensive times.Thank you for being a loyal guest of our Best Western PLUS Hacienda Hotel Old Town. While it sounds like youve had overall pleasant experiences, were sorry to note that you feel the overall value is lacking for the rate. Were sharply competitive with comparable hotels in and around Old Town but as you said, the rates can fluctuate with the seasons and special events.

There are several patio areas with tables and chairs, fountains and blooming bougainvillea and succulents. The hotels walkways are accented with beautiful tiles.

I am not a chronic complainer, but this is one of my rare negative reviews.I stayed at the Best Western Hacienda Old Town for 2 nights on November 8th and 9th. My stay started out very positive, but ended on a negative note.First, the positives:Its a great location is the heart of Old Town San Diego. The hotel has a great restaurant on site Old Town Tequila Factory which I rated favorably. Dozens of other restaurants and shops are within a short walk.The Old Town Transit Center is also a few blocks away. There, you can hop on the Trolley to go to Downtown, Qualcomm Stadium and the Mission Valley shopping malls.The negatives:This location charges for parking -- 15 per day (10 for AAA members). This is also one of the few Best Westerns which doesnt offer a free breakfast (AAA members get a 25 discount off their breakfast buffet).My biggest complaint is that I didnt receive any housekeeping service on Monday. When I complained to the Front Desk on Tuesday, they made matters worse.I was traveling on vacation and wanted to sleep later on Monday morning, so I put out my Do Not Disturb sign. I removed the DND sign at 10am Monday when I left for the day. I returned to my room after the football game at 10:30pm to discover that my room was never cleaned.When I mentioned this Tuesday morning, the Front Desk clerk turned the problem around and basically said that it was MY fault that my room wasnt cleaned. I should have called Housekeeping to request service.I have worked in a hotel for 25 years, so I know thats not the way it works. If there is a DND on the door in the morning, Housekeeping returns after lunch to recheck the room. Clearly, this wasnt done.I am not the type of guest who expects a free stay for any minor problem, but I do think it would be appropriate to receive some compensation for my inconvenience of returning to a dirty room.The price I paid for the room includes the cost of providing housekeeping services. If the hotel fails to provide a promised service, they should not charge for it.I have requested that the hotel issue me a refund for the 20 parking fees which would be 10 discount off my total bill. I think that this would be fair and appropriate amount for returning to a dirty room.The Front Desk Manager has admitted that they made a mistake, but the hotel is refusing to issue a refund or any form of compensation for my inconvenience. In light of this poor customer service, I have given the hotel a Poor rating.Thank you for your feedback. As a result of your review, we have revisited our procedures in order to make the changes needed. I apologize for the housekeeping oversight. Please feel free to reach out to me directly if another stay in Old Town is on your agenda so that I can assign a team member to personalize your experience. Happy Holidays!"},{"0":"Calgary","1":"32.7532","2":"-117.1944","3":"Best Western Plus Hacienda Hotel Old Town","4":"4","5":"We came back after a bad experience last year as the manager offered us a discount to try it out again. Overall the staff were friendly except for when we checked in. We went to the lounge after check in and waited over 15 minutes before being acknowledged (while sitting at the bar), and then another 10 minutes before we received a drink. I really wanted to eat there as the food looked amazing last year, but we chose to dine somewhere else. Our hotel room was beside a meeting room that was booked both mornings of our stay so we were woken up at 6:45am both days. Their food beverages were set up outside our window so it was loud and we were not able to sleep in. The hotel itself is beautiful and the hot tub pool area is a lot of fun.

The exterior is attractive and fits the location (Old Town) however the rooms are run-down dark and noisy. The internet kept dropping us and it was very slow. Breakfast buffet was meager, and the same items daily. Our rate included a free drink, ONE free breakfast per couple, one appetizer. The parking situation is weak. The garage is so tight that many guests took two spots. That is unacceptable someone should enforce that.Thank you for complimenting the attractiveness of our grounds and superior location. The style of the hotel is designed to fit into the vintage California charm of Old Town. Before your next stay, please reach out to either Dean Feather stone (our Asst.

Appreciated that they had a shuttle to pick us up within 20 mins from the airport. Using AAA card gave us a free buffet breakfast which was quite good. We first came on a Weds which was a an evening they had free Mexican food and a drink in the lobby which was good enough for our dinner that night. The room was fine and the beds were comfortable. The staff were all pleasant and even the housekeepers like Carmen, gave us warm greetings each day. The views over the city especially at sunset were enjoyable and the patios had pretty plants. Too chilly in Feb to try the pool but it looked nice. We were in the 300 building the first time and the 600 one the 2nd time. The 600 one takes a bit of effort to wind your way to it through 3 or 4 elevators but the rooms were fine. The Tequila restaurant was good for drinks and a snack and also for meals. Only a matter of a minute to walk to the town or to get the hop on hop off bus. A 5 minute walk takes you to the tram where you can then get a bus to the zoo. Not hard to figure out and the locals were also helpful. Greetings, and thank you for your recent stay. Its always a delight to hear about our guests experience. Your description is filled with great tips which will surely be helpful to those planning a visit. Carmen is an asset to our housekeeping team and will receive recognition!

That means you'll have no problems with the 32oz. margaritas.Rooms are spacious and well-furnished with microwave, coffee machine, hair dryer and safe. The gym is also well-equipped with high quality treadmills and exercise bikes and a universal machine. There are no free weights but there is free bottled water and towels.The breakfast buffet was good but may not be included if you book through a third party site. The hotel is built on a hillside and some of the upper level rooms require some stair climbing. If you wish to avoid that, be sure to ask for a lower level room. Parking is somewhat limited. There is a covered lot that charges a fee for overnight parking or you can choose to park in the free lot on the corner. There are perhaps 20 to 25 spaces in the free lot so plan accordingly.Greetings, and thank you for the excellent, and humorous review!

It used to be a shopping center and has several levels and elevators that sometimes don't work. Be prepared to walk lots of stairs especially if you're in Building 6 like we were. I booked a room with a two queens and a sofa sleeper for our family of five but when we got to our room in Building 4 there was no sofa sleeper. We headed back down to the lobby and the front desk clerk asked, Are you sure We had to laugh at that. Another staff member offered to show us two other room choices. She walked us around to the rooms and was very courteous and professional. Our luggage was moved from the old room to the new room in Building 6 quickly and efficiently. The parking area for Building 6 is very small and fills up early in the evening. The parking spaces themselves are impossibly narrow and hard to get out of. The local channels on our TV were awfully static and hard to watch while the cable stations came in clear. But in spite of all that, our room was clean, comfortable and spacious enough for our family. Old Town is a great area to stay in with lots of restaurants, museums and things to explore. Plus it is centrally located...less than 10 - 15 minutes to Downtown, Balboa Park, La Jolla Cove and the Airport. Good stay, great location!Thank you for your recent stay with us and for taking the time to tell us what you thought! I apologize the room didnt have the sofa sleeper as expected, but Im very happy to hear one of our staff members went the extra mile to remedy the situation and get you into a room suited nicely for your family!

You will need your property map and directions from the front desk, but for me it is worth discovering the beautiful plantings, fountains, plazas and vistas on the different levels.If climbing stairs is an issue make sure your nearest elevator is working and you don't have a room in the one building without elevator access.The breakfast buffet is generous, but for me the best part of the Tequila Factory restaurant is the several open or glass enclosed terrace dining areas which have wonderful views of San Diego harbor and Point Loma in the distance, both in the morning evening.When I visited in October there was an hourly shuttle to the airport and some local landmarks as well as on request pickup from the airport.We're honored to receive your review! As a seasoned traveler and reviewer, you know what it takes to make a hotel stay into a beautiful experience. Thank you for the eloquent descriptions of our property and the photos you attached.

This is a interesting hotel. With a multilevel villa layout. They have a fountain courtyard area. There is also a restaurant up on the hill with a great view. The rooms were decent size and clean. Our room was in the building across from the lobby and we had to walk a distance to find the breakfast area. But the breakfast buffet was very good with lots of choices. We enjoyed staying at the hotel and eating at the restaurant and the buffet breakfast. We will stay there again when in the area. They also had a fun little selfie area where you can get a family picture and it sends it to your phone or email.Thank you for highlighting ambiance, cleanliness and our breakfast buffet at the Old Town Tequila Factory as the reasons you would be inspired to choose us again.

We had such a great time...we are loyal customers to this hotel. The staff is very friendly, and the location is ideal. It's so great to be able to just park your car once, and be within walking distance to Old Town, with lots of shopping and restaurants like Fred's. We had a gorgeous view, with a perfect room with a nice balcony, overlooking the pool. It's a nice, quiet hotel, even while being over the pool! The decor is nice, and the lack of noise was amazing. Even with a wedding reception going on below, we still slept great!"},{"0":"Northampton","1":"32.7532","2":"-117.1944","3":"Best Western Plus Hacienda Hotel Old Town","4":"4","5":"Arrived early rooms wasnt ready, so took a walk around the old town. Very Mexican also very quaint. The hotel its self was very nice, staff help full. Our room was good size with a balcony over looking the pool. Tried the restaurant one night, found the food to be very tasteful. A wonderful waiter whos name I forgot ( sorry ) was very informative about San Diego. Overall a lovely hotel and wound recommended and definitely stay again if ever in San Diego. Thank you for your recent stay at our Best Western. Im happy to hear you took a stroll through Old town while waiting for your room. Did you get a chance to see the Heritage Park or the Whaley (haunted) House next door There is a lot of history here!

My room never got cleaned, the young lady at the front desk on Friday was just plain rude when answering questions about the hotel. There were numerous areas of the hotel that needed attention badly. From a distance it looks beautiful, but up close the hotel was just plain dirty and run-down. I fully realize this Best Western because of it's location does a huge volumn of business, which is all the more reason that things should be kept in much better condition. I would love to visit again because the views are wonderful and the beds are comfortable. However, the water running all night as well as the unkept grounds and bad service may cause me to change my mind. I am afront office manager at another BW location and I simply can't believe the things I saw and heard during my visit to this property."},{"0":"Reedley","1":"32.7532","2":"-117.1944","3":"Best Western Plus Hacienda Hotel Old Town","4":"1","5":"The Hotel has terrible WiFi that randomly disconnects every few seconds. The parking is bad and there are only like 2 elevators. This hotel is not meant for disabled people or elderly, even those who have trouble walking up stairs or have bad knees. I had to carry all my suitcases up three flight of stairs just to get to my room. I even had to help two elderly people carry their suit cases up the stairs. The layout of the hotel map is confusing as it is. If anything the Hotel needs to add more elevators for each building and not only for two buildings. The only reason I booked this hotel was due to the lack of hotels during Comic Con. I won't be going to this hotel again.I am so sorry to hear you experienced inconveniences while getting around the property. This is not the kind of experience we want our guests to have. Our team can usually assist folks with luggage and getting to the room, as most hours we do have a bellman. Also, seven of our eight buildings have elevators. Again, my apologies we did not better anticipate your needs.

It is a very nice hotel with all the ammenities you would need but not all you might find in a five star hotel. But , considering the location to the airport, Amtrak Location, and Old Town ( a very nice array of restaurants,bars and gift shops in a revitalized set of buildings dating back to the late 1880's. You can walk and see a great deal. Legoland is about 45 minutes north of the hotel in Carlsbad. And, about 20 minutes from the San Diego Zoo. Both attractions are family related . You will spend the entire day at each location. Back at the hotel, you will find a parking fee of 10.00 a night. The restaurant located just at the back of the facility has a nice bar,with lots of t.v.s playing sporting events and a restaurant that offers a nice meal at a 10- 20 range . Here's the deal though ! If you are a AAA Automobile member, you can't get a better deal ,period! If you use your AAA card you pay up 20 off per night, 50 off the parking per night and 2 free buffet breakfasts each day of your stay. Use the card and you will return home filled with happy thoughts knowing you had a great time and won't have a huge credit card bill the following month.Thank you for your loyalty!

The location is great for walking around the Old Town area, and conveniently located to drive most places in San Diego. I think this place has a bit of arrogance in the way their run their business, though. When we arrived to move into our room with bay views, we got shoveled in a dirty, smelly room in the far upper corners of a building facing a park. I called the office and asked why we were paying for a bay view and got this room. We had to haul our luggage back down to the parkade and drive all the way back to the office to talk to them. They seemed quite upset that we were questioning the room we got they tried again with a room directly across from the stairwell facing a wall, but we refused that room as well. Their third try was this is the last room we have, which we took. It did face the bay, but was a corner room with the stairwell right in front of the door, which made it a little noisy when people's children were running up and down the stairs and breezeways. It was quite a big larger than the first room they tried to put us in, though. When I asked why we didn't get the room we had booked months in advance, the response was we're full. Huh Stay was OK because we didn't have to engage with the staff again until we checked out. Lots of steps and climbs up and down the road if you're in the upper buildings. Restaurant staff on the arrogant side as well. Must be catchy at this hotel! Parking is horrible - don't bring anything bigger than a Ford Fiesta! Wouldn't stay here again. Sadly, they have a great location, but really indifferent, slightly arrogant, almost rude staff. I'd head for Coronado next time!"},{"0":"Scottsdale","1":"32.7532","2":"-117.1944","3":"Best Western Plus Hacienda Hotel Old Town","4":"4","5":"Stayed 2 nights in April 2013. Well maintained and nicely landscaped property. The property is on a hill overlooking the Main Street of old Town San Diego with more Mexican restaurants than you ever thought possible. Getting back to your room on the hill may be a workout since you are going uphill. Bed was very comfortable and firm as that is my personal preference. The property covers 5+ acres so navigating the several different buildings can be a little tricky although they provide a colorful property map. The property is definitely older but it is clean and I did feel safe there at night although it is not the best lit property at night. Rooms are a little dark, however, and my room did not have a balcony and am not sure any did. They have two parking garages but small. They do charge 14/night extra for self parking. Overall, a good stay if you are looking for a sale, clean comfortable place to use as a base to do the tourist thing.Thank you for making the Best Western PLUS Hacienda Hotel Old Town your base for San Diego adventures! We appreciate the thoughtfulness you put into your review. It will be helpful for guests planning travel.

Couldn't believe it could be as good as I was reading for the price I was given. Well it is everything and more. It is a 3 floor hotel with elevator and easy to climb stairs. The room was just beautiful, as nice as a 5 star hotel I had previously stayed in. They offer a free breakfast with juic3, coffee, eggs, bacon, waffles, donuts, toast, danish and more. I couldn't believe how much when I walked in. The room was a bit small but people were nice with making room. This hotel is so close to Old Town and Sea World you never need to get back on the freeway unless you chooose to. I went up to Mission Bay and followed that into Old Town. Rooms are a great size also and lots of parking available. Its a fantastic hotel to choose and I will stay here on my next San Diego visit. The staff was the friendliest people I have ever met. The man who checked me in made sure I was happy and under stood everything. Pool has a code and he explainex that and it opened very easily. Nice pool abd nice spa. I liked that when I checked in the gentleman wrote the pool code and breakfast hours on the paper that held the room key. Very very professional and friendly. I didnt want to go home. Great Hotel.

We had three rooms with exterior access on the third floor. The second night there we realized why we were so warm was that our window was ajar by about 6 inches. So we closed and locked the window, and called the front office to inquire why it was opened. The front office said housekeeping must have opened it. I had my family close their windows also.Imagine our dismay the next day, when we stopped back to our rooms around 5pm, and all our windows were once again open. It would have been an easy matter for anyone to take a knife and slit the screen, slide the window fully open, and climb into our rooms. One of our rooms was occupied by a 23 yr old young woman. We once again relocked our windows. I can only guess that housekeeping was instructed to turn off the air conditioning, it was mid-70's, and open the window when they cleaned the rooms. I noticed other rooms on the 2nd floor were also left the same way.When I checked out I told Bill the manager that compromising the safety of guests was not acceptable. And, my guess is that housekeeping was told to open all the windows as part of the daily routine. I was not pleased he blamed housekeeping. I promised to inform Best Western at corporate headquarters and write a review, and I did both. Corporate was very supportive and shared my concern in regards to hotel safely. I have no doubt they took the appropriate action and future guests are now safe. But, check your windows when you return each night!Your business is very important to us and we value your feedback. By telling us what you liked about your stay and how we can improve, you are helping us deliver a superior experience for you and other guests in the future. We are very sorry housekeeping kept your windows open during your stay. It's not a policy that we keep them closed but after mentioning it to the front desk staff.They should have been closed after they were done cleaning the rooms. Also they're are devices that keep our windows from opening more than 6 inches to prevent intruders from entering the room. We are very sorry you felt your safety was compromised but I assure you that never has there been any incidents were any of our rooms have been broken into."},{"0":"Zionsville","1":"32.7895","2":"-117.204","3":"Best Western Mission Bay","4":"5","5":"Room was very clean, beds comfortable.

It is old, dingy, and dark. The room was very dated and had a very dark appearance although there was a front window. The outside walkway, as mentioned by another traveler, is slanted and uneven. The elevator is scary. The breakfast room looks like it used to be a sleeping room and is very dated and dark. The food is typical continental breakfast food. Overall, I would say spend more money and stay somewhere else.Good Morning,Thank you for sharing your review regarding your recent stay here at the Best Western Mission Bay. On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. I sincerely appreciate your compliments to our location, just within minutes to most attractions here in San Diego. I apologize for the outside look of our property. Unfortunately, the property next door to ours was just demolished, giving our area a run-down look. We are anticipating construction for the new businesses there within the next year hopefully this will improve the feel of our property.I hope you will consider staying with us again so that we can have another chance to provide you with a superior experience.

The bathroom was the right size and we had planty of room for relaxing and dining. I have 2 small children and they were very comfortable. To keep them busy, I hooked up my media streamer to the LCD tv and away the kids went with their cartoons. The pool was a nice plus. While not too large, it was plenty for the people that partook. The kids made many friends while at the pool and we had several kids come to our room to invite my kids to come down to the pool. I can't say enough about the breakfast. The days we were at the hotel, the breakfast was amazing. Eggs, bacon, muffins, cereal, jucies, waffles, etc...just about everything that my kids love for breakfast. Different days had different breakfast specials. One day was breakfast sandwiches which were quite good. Another day was breakfast burritos which were also quite good, but there was no salsa. Luckily, we had salsa in the room. Overall, I was very pleased with our stay at this hotel.Thank you for taking time to share your great experience with our hotel.

That area is also very, very busy with lots of traffic. The Best Western Mission Bay was literally right over the bridge from Mission Bay which made getting to the water very easy. However, I was disappointed that there are no ocean views from any of the rooms. Being this close to the water, I thought there would be.My room was comfortable, though there were some snags. First, the red light on my phone kept flashing the entire length of my stay, even though I told the front desk about it immediately upon my check in. It was a three week old message to someone who had stayed in that room previously.Also, the ice machine did not work on my floor, and I had to go to another floor every time I needed ice. Again, I informed the front desk about the non-functioning ice machine within an hour of my arrival and they just told me to use one on another floor. (I was on the top floor, and the elevator was s---l---o---w.) The ice machine still was not fixed by the end of my stay.The third annoyance was that there was no remote for the television when I checked in. However, they did send someone to my room with a remote within 20 minutes of my calling the front desk.On a positive note, the bed was very comfortable, and the staff friendly. The best thing was the complimentary breakfast every morning. It had something for everyone and was very good. This really is a welcome amenity for me, since I don't like having to search out and drive to a restaurant first thing in the morning to have breakfast.The Best Western Mission Bay is a comfortable, no frills, convenient place to stay if you are just looking for a place to sleep and change clothes. Overall it seemed clean and safe. A few steps up from a Motel 6, but not a fancy resort either. A good compromise for the price.Good Afternoon,We would like to thank you for staying with us and posting a review for Tripadvisor.Thank you so much for your compliments to our property.

After staying one night, I have to disagree. I suppose if you are staying and you have a car, it probably is a good location because it's really close to the highway- but we only stayed one night, so we didn't have a car, and the location was terrible. There was nothing to do near the hotel, I am not from the area, so it was hard for me to tell if this is a 'good area' or not, but I was not about to walk around alone. Our hotel room was clean and comfortable, but we only had one working outlet in the room. All of the other outlets were a major fire hazard as they only allowed the plugs to go in half-way. Breakfast was fine, but crowded and I couldn't get the wifi to work. As we were checking out, we watched a mouse swimming around in the pool. With all the being said- every single hotel employee that I spoke with was extremely kind and helpful.

It smelled like someone tried to cover a moldy smell with air freshener that smelled like cologne. Though the bed was comfortable, the sheets were dirty on one of the beds, as if someone had walked across it with shoes on. The room had a mini fridge but it was turned down to 1 so I had to turn it on to store my food items. I was given room 115, which unfortunately for me was right near the breakfast area so as soon as breakfast was available I was woken up by everyone walking by and holding loud conversations. Then at 7:45am, what I can only assume was a dance troop staying there, started practicing their routines in the middle of the parking lot while blasting their music and yelling. At 9am when I went to check out they were still going strong and oblivious to anyone trying to navigate the lot. When I was trying to back up, one of them walked up behind my vehicle and I had to ask them to move. Then after pulling out of my spot and attempting to leave, a few of them almost walked right in front of me because they were not paying attention. I find it extremely RUDE that they assumed everyone would be wide awake and want to listen to this. I also find it RUDE that the hotel manager did not go out there and ask them to stop because it may be disturbing other guests.

This time, there were no real issues, other than the carpeting seemed a bit damp/dirty even with socks. Showered, and found clean socks/feet were a bit dirty from walking around the room, within short amount of time. To me, simply shampooing would help.

The main parking lot features a poor design, it is difficult to navigate when stuffed full of trucks, and other vehicles that should have been parked in the overflow lot provided to the side of the hotel. There were derelicts floating about the hotel and parking lot, which made me wonder whether my car and the contents would be there when I awoke in the morning, I was on a road trip back to Mexico with a full load and didn't really want to have to unpack an entire SUV late at night and have to try to piece it all back together in the morning. The room felt stale and just not clean, although I'm sure that it was, it just didn't feel clean, or look clean, the place is in need of an overhaul and I feel that I could have just crashed at a Motel 6 and left the next day feeling like I needed a shower just the same.Good Afternoon,Thank you for taking time to review your stay with us here at the Best Western Mission Bay.On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations.I apologize you were unable to find a parking space by your room.

I knew we wouldn't be in the room much so we didn't care about having a nice pool, view, etc. we just needed a clean place to sleep and that's what we got. I was a bit concerned because the hotel was either full or close to it and was quite noisy. We were in the room next to the ice machine which was really loud. By the time we got back from our evening out, about 10pm, all was quiet and we got a good night sleep. The room was nothing special but clean and suited our needs.

My family scheduled a trip to San Diego on Dec 2014 and we stayed there from Dec 9 to Dec 13 at room 231. During the time, we visited Sea world, Legoland, midway aircraft carrier museum, etc. Every night, we had a good sleep when we back exhausted from a whole day's trip.On the last day, In haste to catch our flight at LA, I left my wallet in room 231. The time I noticed it missing we were already back to my home in Canada. I called the hotel. The gentleman who pick up the phone was very kind and he asked me to leave my contact information. I am so happy the next day, because my wife told me that she got called from a Lady from your hotel that my wallet was found. And with your help mailing it to my home in Canada, I finally got all my card back (Driver license, debit cards, credit cards, insurance card, etc).

It kept the room nice and not humid, and it was quiet, too. We had a King bed with a mini-fridge and microwave. The Desk area had plenty of outlets for charging gadgets. The bed area could use more outlets for things like CPAP machines. (We went and bought an extension cord.) The sink area had a large counter surface, and the bath area was nice sized with a shower over the tub. Staff was courteous and efficient. The pool is small and was well used.

I found the Best Western Yacht Hotel to be close to boththese (they are actually located within a stone's throw of eachother, the airport, and the conference venue). This also markedthe first time when I have walked from an airport to my hotel,and back. The weather was great, which made the walking quitepleasant. All lie along the North Harbor Drive. The room waswell-stocked in terms of the amenities, and the room service wasgood. Fresh apples were available in the lobby. Room amenitiesincluded an iron, an ironing board, a hairdryer, a TV set, anintercom/phone, a refrigerator, a kettle, and a coffee-maker.

When we arrived the staff were friendly and helpful, and there were free freshly cooked cookies and coffee in the foyer . There were 2 restaurants virtually opposite the hotel, however, they were pricey, probably due to their location. There were several cheap and cheerful restaurants that were within a very short distance at the back of the hotel, which we walked to. The only downside is it was quite noisy from the road. On our last night there were road repairs going on all night, which were particularly noisy as they were using a pneumatic drill.

C' un parcheggio gratuito proprio sotto l'hotel che facilita carico-scarico bagagli. La posizione buona anche se bisogna comunque usare l'auto per andare in citt. Unica nota un po' stonata, la colazione non abbondante e un po' scarsa e lo spazio limitato dedicatole.

Best Western Yacht Hotel was in a convenient location to visit family. We keep making the mistake of booking hotels that offer free breakfast, which we immediately regret when we sample breakfast. Brown-crusted scrambled eggs cold and greasy tater tots. Breakfast sausages are fine the first morning, but when they are served a second morning, they taste like rubber. Paper thin walls and noisy neighbors does not a good night's sleep make! Everything else was fine.

It's simply not worth it. Therefor I will only point out the things I disliked.Unprofessionel people at the reception.Room was not cleaned well. There was still stuff of earlier people in the room.Housekeeping forgot pillowcovers and towels multiple times.Pool was closed for a complete day due to some safety tiles that needed to be added to the pool side. In my opinion, this could have been done in less time.Loud radio was played in the pool area. When I addressed this, I was not taken seriously. The sliding door to the balcony has no insulation, resulting in that all outside sounds and noise would come in the room.Internet was almost non existent. Upload and download speeds were less than 0,5 Mbs.Please consider another hotel for a few dollars more. The location is good, thats it.I will never return to this hotel.I would like to apologize for the inconvenience.Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave us to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future.

The rooms were large and clean. The bathrooms were also quite large. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful. Good views of the Point Loma Yacht Harbor if you reserved a harbor view. We rented our room through our airline website. We were required to pay in advance. Free continental breakfast and toast/waffles that you can make for yourself.There are a few restaurants within walking distance or if you wish to walk a little longer (about 20 minutes) there are many restaurants in the Pt. Loma marina area. The rooms have WiFi although in the two rooms we've rented, the signal is a bit weak. TVs recently upgraded to modern LCD screens. Microwave oven, hair dyer, iron, refrigerators are in the rooms.I'd stay there again but it is by no means a fancy place to stay.Oh yes, there is some road noise as it is located on Harbor Drive. You'll also hear the flag up/down ceremonies at the Naval Base across the street but the morning one is at 8:15 AM so not too early."},{"0":"Weston super Mare","1":"32.7262","2":"-117.2254","3":"Best Western Yacht Harbor Hotel","4":"2","5":"We had an amazing road trip, after getting married in Las Vegas, ending in San Francisco. This hotel however was the biggest disappointment of our trip. We had booked the Hilton, but then found this at half the cost decided to book it so we could spend our money on other things. We wished we'd stuck with the Hilton. I'm not normally one for writing a bad review (in fact it's my 1st I feel like I'm being mean!) it wasn't really that bad, it just wasn't the best one on our trip. We'd booked a cheaper one in Morro Bay, (we wanted to experience a Motel) which knocked the socks of this hotel for both room service!Before we arrived we had emailed the hotel to let them know we had just got married, to ask if they had any upgrades. They kindly offered us 2 options: a free upgrade to a garden view or a paid one into a front facing harbour view. We said yes to the paid one, as it was our honeymoon after all. When we arrived at the hotel, the guy on reception had no details about it at all. When we asked about it he said we would have to speak to the manager in the morning and see if there were any free the next day. We were disappointed to say the least, especially as we had the email with the confirmation. We didn't bother speaking to the manager the next day, we were only there for 2 nights didn't want to spend the time moaning:) So we just took the room they had. It was ok. We found out it was the garden view (overlooking 3 palm trees:)). It was clean did the job. Breakfast was not great. Greasy food most of it looked unhygienic. So I didn't bother. My husband ate the bagels. Before we went out for the day I asked reception about a group of seals we had heard about by the harbour where we were likely to find them. He basically laughed at me and said 'you'll just hear them, they are everywhere'. Thought it was a bit rude. As it turns out we saw hundreds all the way up highway 1, quite an experience for us coming from the UK. If you just want a cheaper option for a pit stop, it will do the job. It was clean after all. If you want somewhere nicer, book the Hilton."},{"0":"San Diego","1":"32.7262","2":"-117.2254","3":"Best Western Yacht Harbor Hotel","4":"4","5":"Staff was very friendly and went beyond their job duties to accommodate us. The breakfast was good and it changed every day. It would be nice if they had more of a selection but overall was good. Room facing the harbor are very big and have a wonderful view.

No issues. Parking is good compared to neighboring hotel. Quick checkout but not sure I got receipt in my email yet from a week ago. Easy access to the Marina.

What drew me in was the location, proximity to airport as well as the free parking, which is a money saver. We were a little disappointed in the neighborhood there were not a lot of food options nearby, but when it was time for us to head to the airport we were 5 minutes away. The parking was free, which is great, but there is no elevator from either level of the parking. We had very large suitcases and it was just myself and my small children so it was a bit of a struggle. The lobby is small, but clean. The staff were friendly and professional. The pool is located in front of the hotel, on the main road and is quite small. There was a laundry room on our floor, but did not use it. Our room was fine, clean and neat. The hotel itself is a little old and it is showing its age, but not necessarily in a bad way. Negatives are the beds were extremely hard and uncomfortable, at least for us. Also, we were placed on the second floor, but it seemed to be more the first floor. The parking was directly outside our room and cars were parked immediately in front of our patio, so close we could have reached out and touched them. I wasn't a fan of this as people came back to the hotel at 3 am, parked immediately in front of our room and were having trouble locking their car door so the car kept beeping it's horn. Also, starting at 6 am there are jet planes flying over. It wasn't bothersome to us, kids slept right through it. We would stay here again, just request a higher floor, maybe not facing the parking area."},{"0":"Modena","1":"32.7262","2":"-117.2254","3":"Best Western Yacht Harbor Hotel","4":"5","5":"Ottimo hotel situato in buona posizione a met strada tra le spiaggie e Downtown.

We live in Denver. Arrived expecting a bay view room non-smoking (yes, this property still allows smoking!). The door key would not work and had to ask three times at the counter for help. When we did get in, room was a smoking room! Counter manager said I should have booked directly with the property and not through the BW website!. Ended up in a room with two double beds on another floor. The front desk staff is not friendly and the manager looks like he just got out of bed! Moving to the Holiday Inn next door on our next trip.Good afternoon,We cater to all guest and there's still guest that smoke, so we need to take care of them also.

King bed was bottomed out on one side..the other side was fine so I just slept on the one good side. No hot water 2nd day for about 2 hours--right after I got back from the gym needed that shower so that put my drive to L.A. back 2 hours. (hair dryer didn't work). There was a leaky ceiling in the lobby dripping into a floor basket--and what ever caused that problem seemed to affect my room water service. When the hot water went down the toilet stopped flushing properly--that lasted 2 days before being fixed. The breakfast here was poor. Each morning there was a basket of black bananas there were the usual sweets (muffins and frosted sugary treats). There was some kind of weird egg that was folded to look like a mini omelette--stuffed with orange cheese. It was kind of rubbery and tasted weird. The potatoes were dry and kind of like tator tots. I just stayed with coffee and juice after the 1st day. There was a front desk person that kept referring to me as boss...no problem boss you got it boss, etc. I thought that was unprofessional and a demeaning term. You may use the term boss on a construction site or road crew, but not in a professional environment. When I checked out the lady at registration didn't even ask how my stay was..or wish me a good trip as I left..I felt she could care less. You have MANY options during your stay in San Diego. So consider your plans before booking here. By the way this hotel is located on a very busy street. Lots of traffic noise as Harbor Drive is a main road traveled coming out of the airport.

We arrived at the hotell and was disappointed to find our view from our 2nd floor room. Was nothinf more than the very tops of sailing mast, behind buildings, way off in the distance. And since the hotel is fronted by a busy 4 lane highway. The road noise on our small balcony, was so loud, you had to shout over the loud road noise, making it useless. Apon request, we move to 4th floor rm. The room's AC unit was so load, it should never been offer and was probably the reason it hadn't already been booked and leftout of service. Since there really isn't much of a view of the harbour, we gave up on a veiw rm and moved to a 3rd floor quite parking lot side room. But the rugs here had been shampoo and were soaken wet. So we moved again, to a different 3rd floor quite paking lot view room. I think we'd paid extra for the harbour view room to bega with, it's not worth it and we never were offer a refund for the different type room we stayed in.

We arrived early at the airport but there was no problem catching a shuttle to the hotel. The hotel representative gave us great directions to reach the pick-up point. When we arrived at the hotel, we were able to check-in early always a great treat. All front desk staff were courteous, friendly and helpful throughout our stay. Also, housekeeping provided great service too.The hotel sits in an excellent location just opposite the harbor. We were able to walk over to watch the fishing charters going in and out as well as sailing regattas on the weekend. There are also several restaurants in that area. We particularly enjoyed Mitchs Seafood.Our room was spacious and spotless. It had a small microwave as well as an oversized mini-frig. There was a desk area and, of course, free wifi was included. Each room has a balcony which is perfect in the cool evenings. From the hotel its a quick walk to a nearby Ralphs grocery where we purchased a few snacks/beverages. The ice machines always had plenty of ice.Our room rate included a great hot breakfast buffet which varied daily. There were always scrambled eggs, toast, bagels, muffins, cereal, yogurt, fruit and a pancake machine. The hot items varied each morning: diced potatoes plus biscuits gravy then sausage plus tater tots then bacon plus tater tots. The staff members did a great job of keeping items replenished as well as wiping down tables. The breakfast area is a bit small but an overflow room was set-up next door until renovation of the area can be completed.Speaking of renovations, we were amazed each morning as to the progress being made on re-doing the first floor flooring. The new flooring looks terrific! Also the lobby area is lovely and there is coffee/tea available there 24 hrs. Theres a nice sitting area by the pool/hot tub as well as a couple of tables outside the pool area.We definitely enjoyed our stay and recommend this property to others. When were next in San Diego, this is the place we will stay.

Parking is close and convenient, with no added fee, the rooms were cleaner, the hotel service was friendlier, helpful, considerate, and provided all kinds of information, on places to eat, directions, areas to visit, etc. The rate was pretty much the same, maybe a few dollars more, but when you include the daily parking fee, the Yacht Harbor is a better deal. The balconies were nice, to look out to the harbor, but the traffic noise was the downfall. The sliders need to be changed out, could here cars driving by constantly. Breakfast was very good, breakfast at Bayside, you had to walk a block to go in the restaurant, the menu and serving times were not in sync, like other Best Westerns. The bayside needs help. stay at the HARBOR, YOU'LL BE GLAD YOU DID."},{"0":"San Diego","1":"32.7262","2":"-117.2254","3":"Best Western Yacht Harbor Hotel","4":"5","5":"I got the room, view and bed I requested for my family of three. We had a beautiful view of the harbor but I was a little bit bummed I couldn't see downtown due to a stairwell blocking that view. We were on the fifth floor though and had a view of the pool which was helpful when our 15 year old son went swimming and I was able to call down to him when I had a question for him. Our son came with us at the last minute so we had to add on a rollaway bed and that caused no problem at all. We left the hotel, shortly after checking in and when we returned, the bed was there. The room and rest of the hotel was clean and inviting. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room was hot when we first arrived but the air conditioner worked perfect and cooled it down in little time. Our son used the pool and swam alone (for the first time in his life) for the entire time he was there. The pool temp and condition was perfect and he said it was nice and he really liked it. Even though the hotel was sold out, we never felt like it was crowded and never heard our neighbors. We also found parking in the covered lot on both nights we arrived back late. The breakfast was just ok. It is a continental breakfast though so in that vein, it was normal. However, it was very clean in the room and pleasantly decorated and arranged. They had a separate dining area for overflow or if you didn't want to be in the room with the food prep and television. The staff were friendly and helpful. Overall, we had a wonderful stay here and I'd definitely return to the same location to stay overnight again. The highlight was walking out onto our balcony, on the last morning we were there (on a Sunday), to the view of the harbor with The Star Spangled Banner playing on speakers nearby, just loud enough for me to get misty-eyed. Beautiful moment."},{"0":"Boston","1":"32.7262","2":"-117.2254","3":"Best Western Yacht Harbor Hotel","4":"1","5":"All night street and airplane noise ruined my San Diego stay.

The rate was very good for the San Diego area since it not located outside of the main tourist area but the location adjacent to the 15 means that all the major tourist sites and beach is within 20-30 minutes.

After feigning hearing issues with her behind glass, I asked to be let in the lobby and was let in and saw security camera monitors were pointed at every possible corner of the grounds. We got a room on the 3rd floor and the automatic door facing the hall to the rooms was broken. We had to walk all the way around the outside. We get to the elevator and its down for maintenance. I went back into the lobby and asked for a first floor room or second floor at least and she gave us one. When we got in the room though we were pleasantly surprised. The room looked updated for the most part with a nice granite counter outside the bathroom, counter height refrigerator and microwave. Horrible outdated tv though and ours had a loud screeching sound until it got warmed up. Bathroom was unbearably small. You had to step in and go behind the toilet to close the door. Outlets were lacking too. My husband and I both use our cell phones as alarms and want to plug in our phones next to the bed but there were not outlets anywhere near it. I had to unplug a lamp on the other side of the room. Beds and pillows were comfortable. Breakfast was blah but I wasn't expecting much from continental. Lo and behold, something else was broken! There are two Belgian waffle makers and one was out of order so we waited a very long time for our turn. Cereal, pastries, toast, coffee, etc. Every piece of fruit I got was a little past prime. Nothing to rave about.Overall, for the money, great deal and adequate for short hotel stay."},{"0":"Menifee","1":"32.8923","2":"-117.1188","3":"Best Western San Diego/Miramar Hotel","4":"4","5":"Had a room in the corner of the main building on the westernmost side -- be advised that the rooms on this end are subject to a lot of road noise, so if you're sensitive to that, request another room or bring ear plugs.

I asked for any room, I'm not picky. he said sure we have one for ya...then I mentioned the corporate card I travel for business on and was told, he would see if he had a room.(card is for discounted rates like AAA) I then mentioned that I had a rewards number I wished to use and he handed me back the rewards card and said that the rewards points would not be awarded on discounted rates. (I have received rewards points on EVERY hotel I checked into with this same card including BW plus, Holiday inn, comfort/quality...every one! ) he then answered the phone again and interupted our conversation without even saying excuse me or anything...and after a few minutes of being ignored I left and told them i would find another hotel that was friendlier.I went a little farther toward the jobsite and got a room at another Best Western in Santee...where they are friendly and I really liked the empolyees and the location.

Will never make that mistake again. Pulled into hotel lot on a Saturday night about 10:00 p.m. Lot was COMPLETELY full even at that fairly early hour, lot spaces are very inadequate to the number of rooms. Finally managed to find a place after circling four times. Just as I was only pulling my bags out, three cars in the lot, all vehicles carrying gangbanger types drove by (looking to park at the hotel, not leaving), looking at me and scoping out my car. Similar type patrons in the lobby and around the exterior corridors of the hotel. I am not shy about travel, I have walked and worked in rough downtown areas, but I do expect to feel at least a modicum of safety for my person and belongings/vehicle. As I was walking to the lobby, two police cruisers came into the lot, one to circle, the other to park for awhile. At that point, I had it -- I informed the management that I would rather waste my priceline bid and go stay somewhere else, which I did. I am very disappointed that a Best Western would allow this activity on its property. The police did not seem to act like this was an isolated incident, but rather one of their regular patrols. I do not leave a negative review unless I feel it really warrants it, and this one wins first prize for me. I will never book this property again, let alone stay here. It is unsafe-feeling, and I would never take a family here.On behalf of myself and the entire staff here at the Best Western Inn Miramar, we are saddened to hear that a guest was displeased with his recent experience at the hotel. We pride ourselves on excellent guest service, beautiful and comfortable accommodations, and a safe and pleasant experience. The location of this hotel is in close proximity to the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar and is a very safe location. One of our most respected accounts is one that is with a Marine Division on this base. During the evening this guest checked in with us we had a large group of this Marine Division staying with us. We feel privileged to have the Marine Division stay at the Best Western Inn Miramar. They are the very men and women who protect our country and we are honored to have them at the hotel. They are often times not in military uniform during their stay at the hotel but are by no means gangbangers. They are polite, quiet, and very respectable guests. We have a very close relationship with their command and have never had any problems with them in the many years they have used us as their preferred hotel. To ensure the safety of all of our guests we have area officers occasionally do courtesy visits to the hotel as they do other hotels in the surrounding area. The Best Western Inn Miramar is in a very safe area and is located in a county with a dedicated and very courteous police force. There was no activity going on at the hotel and we thank the police for being kind enough to check up on us once in awhile, stop in for a cup of coffee and say hello. We appreciate their service.We are sorry that the guests experienced anything but absolute satisfaction during his visit as it is our goal to provide nothing but the best for each and every one of our guests whether they are business men, military soldiers, sports teams, or family vacationers.

The first night, the A/C unit was like a Mack truck idling inside the room. We asked the front desk next morning for a fix or a room change. Within an hour or so, maintenance was checking out the problem and told us they would replace the unit. When we returned that night, it appeared to be a new unit and was blissfully quiet (well, as quiet as those things get). Nice job!Breakfast was crowded a couple of times but mostly OK. Selection was good - the usual waffle makers, cereal, fruit, pastries, bread, muffins, yogurt, small hot buffet - varied parings of scrambled eggs, omelets, sausage, potatoes (and inexplicably once, baked beans). Decent quality and efficiently maintained.The room was clean and quiet (some traffic noise in the morning). There were elephants upstairs but we never heard their voices. Biggest negative would be parking. There is simply not enough of it and it is packed tighter than an Olympian's spandex. Still, we always found a spot SOMEWHERE, even in the spots by the front entrance marked 15 minute parking only. The front desk acknowledged that was OK. Overall, this was a very decent value for the price and I would have no qualms about returning.Dear Steve7028Thank you for your feedback regarding your stay at the Best Western San Diego Miramar.

Our main goal was a safe clean place in San Diego with breakfast within a budget and this Best Western checked those boxes. It is no longer a Best Western Plus. You can see the old sign on the ground in the parking lot. I forgot to ask front desk about the change. The breakfast included with the price of the room still makes them better than other Best Western hotels in the area but there must be other requirements to keep the Plus title.

We would like to thanks the Asian lady who worked at the front desk and assisted us when we check-in to the hotel late at night. She was very patient with us and went out of her way to help us find the most suitable and comfortable room for our staying. We have to request room change for three times. The first room assigned was not clean, and the second one we moved to turned out to be the smoking room, but we requested a non-smoking room since we were traveling with two young kids. The lady (sorry that we forgot her name) was very patient with us and have the most positive attitude when helping us finding the most satisfy room for our staying. She also gave us good recommendations on where to find a quick dinning place near the hotel, since it's late at night and we were tired from a long drive. We would like to take this chance to thanks her so much for all her help. The price for the hotel staying was reasonable and it included breakfast. Breakfast area was not big, but had enough space to move around. Breakfast was served from 6am -9am, and as long as you go there early in the morning, before the rush hours (8-9am), you wont have problem to find seating and enjoy your breakfast. Breakfasts are the usual choices, but they will fill you up. It was a good starter in the morning before we headed out to the theme parks. We didn't have the chance to use the in-room microwave, but the refrigerator came in handy. TV was a good size had had enough channels for us to watch. The bed and pillows were comfortable, so we had no problem fall in sleep at night. The only thing we questioned was the in-room safe box. It required a credit card to operate, so we wondered if the hotel would charge us for using it. The neighborhood seemed pretty quiet and safe, even though its close to the freeway, no noise was heard at night, and no weird people hanged around the hotel property. There were plenty of parking spaces around, and we had no problem finding parking space when we returned to the hotel late at night. The pool area looked pretty clean, but we didnt get to use it since our staying was during the cold winter days, we might have enjoy the pool more if we stay during summer time. Overall the hotel staying is a good experience for us. We will recommend this hotel and will likely to stay again if we are returning to the area.Dear Alice C, Thank you for taking the time in reviewing the Best Western Plus San Diego/Miramar. We are thrilled to hear you had a good experience at our hotel. We strive in providing our guests with excellent quality service and are touched you took notice.

Just looking for a place to sleep on the road, but I don't recommend this place even for that. They charge an extra 1 per day (plus tax) for the room safe whether you use it or not. And they don't tell you that until you are checking out, it just shows up on your bill. The check-in clerk the first night was quirky and nice but the other staff throughout our four night stay were not very unfriendly. Housekeeping started knocking on doors to clean the rooms at 7:30 each morning. We were getting ready to leave about 8:30 one morning, loading stuff for our day trip. The maid asked me if I wanted them to skip cleaning our room for the day, since we were next in line and we weren't gone yet. The hot food served for breakfast was marginal. After the first morning, I just went with the cereal or skipped it altogether. Wouldn't stay here again, wouldn't recommend it."},{"0":"Kingman","1":"32.8923","2":"-117.1188","3":"Best Western San Diego/Miramar Hotel","4":"5","5":"I'm kind of a regular at this hotel.

When I arrived at the hotel I was informed succinctly that my reservation came through for a smoking room. Although there were non-smoking rooms available, I was charged 11 to change to a non-smoking room. Calls from customer service agents at Priceline had no effect at all. The front desk clerk admitted to me that this happens very frequently (every day she said) to people who book through Priceline or Hotwire. I believe this hotel is running a scam to earn extra revenue by charging unsuspecting customers extra money for non-smoking rooms. Shameful. I will never stay there again.Let me start by thanking you for completing our Guest Survey regarding your recent stay at our property. I apologize for not exceeding your expectations. We strive to ensure each and every guest experience is satisfying. Please know that we are taking your feedback to heart and focusing on improving. As you know when you buy your room through hotwire / priceline with name your price you are giving up lot of prevallage, such as choice of your hotel, room type ect. This type of booking channel will give you deep discount but any guest request is subject to availabity, if we don't have same room type we offer guest choice to upgrade to diffrent room type and pay the diffrence (once again this upgrade is subject to availability).

The hotel is within a reasonable distance from the site of Alliant U campus. The hotel was clean, the beds were extremely comfortable, and the towels were the best (softest and dried better) than any other we have had this year. Almost like home. The internet connected easily, but the desk provided in our room was small and the only light hung above in the ceiling. The chair provided was not an office type chair, unable to adjust the height. This made internet use a bit more difficult. Breakfast was normal for a Best Western. We chose to go to the IHop just across the street instead for more variety. And that was an experience in itself - a positive one. Overall it was a great price for San Diego. The room was more than adequate for our purposes. And our room was quiet and dark enough. Hate the taxes in San Diego for visitors. Seems to be a growing trend, soak the tourists.Dear Joel,Thank you for investing the time to review your stay with us.

Unfortunately, the room that i ended up with had many problems. All 3 rooms were non-smoking room, but right when i walked into the room, you can smell the aroma of cigarettes. The second problem faced was the dysfunctional microwave in the room. We called the front desk to come fix it for us, they were nice enough to come see what was wrong with it and come fix it however, i don't know what they fixed because the microwave did not heat up the food at all. The third, but biggest, problem was the BED BUGS! Even though they might say their hotel is bug free, we faced these little pests late at night. My son was bitten many times(pictures included) and I was bit once on my eyebrow on the last night. Luckily, we caught one bug that was still moving around in the morning and showed them to the front desk. We asked for a discount because all the nights we stayed there were met with discomfort however the best they did for us was a discount for one night. We called the manager and explained our situations after our stay and he wasn't much of a help either.Thank you for expressing your concerns in regards to your recent experience at the Best Western Miramar. The concerns you have raised are very understandable given what you described, and I appreciate the opportunity to look into it and respond.The global resurgence of bed bugs over the last five years is a widely-recognized problem. It is suspected that this resurgence is a direct result of increased international travel to and from the United States, since bed bugs are easily transported in suitcases, clothing, and purses among other things. To address this growing problems, we have a continuous pest control policy in place at our property and have implemented a thorough training program for our housekeeping and maintenance personnel to assist in the early recognition of infestation.Our certified pest control vendor has visited the property and assures us that there is no current infestation on property. Given the nature of our business, it is our expressed commitment to make sure every guest experience an enjoyable one. Your comfort and satisfaction are very important to us, as you have had a chance to see. We appreciate you taking your time to stay with and write review.

The bottles of water in the room for 2.50 a bottle seemed a bit much since the next best western offered a complimentary bottle of water for their guests. With the price I paid for the room, for them to charge for water we thought it was ridiculous. Plus I stayed at a lot of hotels on this trip and this was the first one to charge a 75 dollar hold for the room in case we caused damages. We drove to san diego from Portland Or, because we couldnt afford to fly we had a credit card with just enough money on it for the room, which we had to get because my brother was graduating from Boot camp, and we had to scramble to find a card to put the money on which took out of our gas money. The king sized bed was actually a queen and the queen beds were double beds. There was hair in my bed the first night and part of a sticky note the second night. The shuttle driver the first night was kind of a jerk he made everyone get on the first shuttle so he didnt have to make a second trip so people were standing and crouching in the aisle and then he told everyone if they can drive they should so they dont have to be on the shuttle. Maui was a great driver but we did not like this other guy. I also had to get my key reactivated 3 times because it stopped working.

We stayed 5 nights at this hotel for a total bill of 307 which is really cheap for San Diego. That price got us a room with 2 queen beds right by the pool (room 103). Room was small as others said but not as small as I thought it would be. There was one night stand between the beds but we could walk around the other sides. The room also had a desk with chair, a dresser, and an upholstered chair. I thought the beds could be more comfortable.

We stayed 5 nights at this hotel for a total bill of 307 which is really cheap for San Diego. That price got us a room with 2 queen beds right by the pool (room 103). Room was small as others said but not as small as I thought it would be. There was one night stand between the beds but we could walk around the other sides. The room also had a desk with chair, a dresser, and an upholstered chair. I thought the beds could be more comfortable.

I'd say mostly positives for us! The property was obviously being attended to while we there, with gardeners replanting and pruning the day we were leaving, the exterior building was being washed down. Very nice plantings all about. Cafe, very satisfactory. Free parking very welcome. Our convention was only a 5 or so minute walk away. We were anticipating free breakfast with the reservation (was discussed when reservation was placed) but because we didn't have documentation of that, we weren't able to counter the front desk assertion that we did not have breakfast with the reservation. So be prepared with your paperwork. Just about once a day, 1 or more of us had our room key cards not work, so we had to go to the front desk to have them reset somewhat tiresome especially because we were housed in the furthest bank of rooms from the office. For the room, yes per other reviews, the a/c is set up such that it's an uneven situation, especially at night when sleeping. We dealt with it. Some sort of problem with shower pipes in the room above, when at 3 and 4 in the morning (!), a loud rattling pipes noise commenced, for a good 10 minutes. We alerted the front desk to the problem in the morning. The noise did not occur the next evening, but it could have been because then there was no one in the room upstairs afterwards during the span of our stay. Sure parking was very tight on the Saturday evening, but it was Saturday night, late we did eventually find a spot.Frig worked well. Plenty of towels. Room didn't at all seem overly dated. Beds were satisfactory. We indulged in the pool one late afternoon, but it ended up being the same time as what appeared to be a family reunion so shifted after a little bit to one of the hot tubs. Very nice nonetheless to have a pool and 2 hot tub options on the property. There is also a small gym facility adjacent to the pool.We would stay here again!Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel. We welcome all guest comments especally when they are so well thought out.

We went to sea world, koby's swap meet and did a lot of shopping. The Hotel has around 200 rooms, one pool, two hot tubs and a small restaurant on site. Some of the rooms come with microwaves, fridges and other necessities. Sadly when I arrived at 3 they didn't have any rooms available for check in. We had to wait for half in hour but I didnt mind because we went out to eat and came back. We walk into our room which was right next to the pool and once we walk in the room had an old big fashion TV with a small fridge and no microwave. I asked about the microwave but all of those rooms were booked even though I booked my room 3 days in advance. The small thing I didn't mind but I did mind when the bath room door would not shut closed and the bed was rock hard. Also the internet they provide is WIRELESS B which is one of the slowest connections possible. I couldn't stream any thing on my laptop and at midnight my wife woke me up because she was hearing a LADY SCREAMING TO DEATH!! I call room service and they said they will send some one to check it out but another twenty minutes passed and the screams came again. Then after another phone call to the front desk we finally got some one to check it out and it was the couple next door fighting and throwing stuff at each other.

The only good thing was my daughter loved the warm pool that doesnt close until 10pm.Dear Guest,We are happy to hear that you had a good trip to San Diego, but we are sorry that the Best Western Seven Seas did not meet your expectations. Our rooms are often booked months in advance, especially for the summer, and unfortunately we cannot always provide last minute bookings with a specific room type. We are in the process now of updating and upgrading our bedding package which includes mattresses. As for the late night disturbance, we apologize that you were not happy with the way the situation was handled. Guest disturbances should be handled in a very sensitive manner, and we have discussed the management of the issue during your stay with our team leaders and their staff. We are always looking for ways to improve and take your comments seriously. It is the mission of our company to see that each of our guests receives an excellent service experience and we are sorry that your stay did not turn out that way. We thank you for staying with us, and for your valuable input to how we can run our business better. Kind Regards and Safe Travels,Best Western Seven Seas Management and Staff","6":"First of all I want to say this was a good trip but not because of the MOTEL. We went to sea world, koby's swap meet and did a lot of shopping. The Hotel has around 200 rooms, one pool, two hot tubs and a small restaurant on site. Some of the rooms come with microwaves, fridges and other necessities. Sadly when I arrived at 3 they didn't have any rooms available for check in. We had to wait for half in hour but I didnt mind because we went out to eat and came back. We walk into our room which was right next to the pool and once we walk in the room had an old big fashion TV with a small fridge and no microwave. I asked about the microwave but all of those rooms were booked even though I booked my room 3 days in advance. The small thing I didn't mind but I did mind when the bath room door would not shut closed and the bed was rock hard. Also the internet they provide is WIRELESS B which is one of the slowest connections possible. I couldn't stream any thing on my laptop and at midnight my wife woke me up because she was hearing a LADY SCREAMING TO DEATH!! I call room service and they said they will send some one to check it out but another twenty minutes passed and the screams came again. Then after another phone call to the front desk we finally got some one to check it out and it was the couple next door fighting and throwing stuff at each other. The worst part was the front desk calls me two hours later to tell me they checked out the problem. This was at TWO in the MORNING!!! I would not recommend this hotel to any one. If you can spear the TEN BUCKS do it. I learned the hard way and went cheap and suffered the worst sleep that day.

Best Western Seven Seas has plenty of convenient parking, and I was able to park either right in front of our door, or at worst, a couple of spaces down. The room was average size and clean, the a/c worked and the shower had good pressure. Nothing fancy but all that we needed, and a good value for the area. It was very convenient to the freeway and we were able to get in and out easily. I took morning walks in the area and I did notice that most of the other hotels on Hotel Circle S also had free parking, but none had such a large and nice complex. I didn't utilize the pool or the hot tub, but I did see that many guests were, and both areas looked well maintained. A young man did come in while I was checking in asking if they had a basketball to go with the basketball hoop. They didn't, so if you think you or your kids want to shoot some hoops, bring your own ball. It is not a court, but just a simple hoop at the end of the parking lot.I will stay there again if in the area.Thank you for being our guest at the Best Western Seven Seas and taking the time to review our property, we really appreciate your feedback.

This Best Western has no staff that reads of que. It is almost as if they are responding by a written list, like a customer support rep from India would. They repeat the same answer over and over rather than trying to listen to you and work on something. I stayed for a week, and during the week I complained that what was supposed to be a queen bed was not. IT was clearly not a queen bed. I am not stupid, I sleep in a queen at home. But the staff was insistent. The manager offered me 25 off per night, which I accepted. But here comes the major issue. On the 13th at departure my card was charged, and the charge approved by the bank for the total bill with the discount. In the next two days a second charge for the exact same amount, but as a different transaction. The accountant Ms. Loupe like all the staff there insisted this is normal, it's just a hold of funds. What funds You already got the money, it's gone from my account to yours. If I had not had the funds in my bank to cover this unwarranted second charge. I would be severely over drawn, and subject to many many fees. This is extremely unprofessional and unacceptable. No hotel should do this, no hotel does this. But they did. Supposedly the charge will drop, but even if it does I am still very unhappy. You can ruin peoples credit by doing this to them. I will talk briefly about everything else. The hotel is older, but well maintained. Parking is plentiful by narrow. During the day behind the office building where the laundry is, the day staff leave a wooden gate open, which extends slightly past the fence. It is extremely tight and difficult to squeeze between it and any parked cars. Additionally there was no handicap parking convenient to the handicap room. The bed was alright, but clearly not the size advertised, as I stated prior. The housekeeper who usually did our rooms was extremely nice, she offered my partner extra coffee for the room, and even asked if we wanted the beds made. As we prefer to use our own blankets.

(Check several sites on the Internet for the best rates under 100 a night. Compare to the Best Western site.)The hotel is more of a motel with exterior hallways and no elevators. The room was small, but clean and adequate. The bed was comfortable, but the mini fridge was quite small. I requested a quiet room since the hotel is next to the freeway. It had a smal pool and two hot tubs. The fitness center was a room next to the pool with only a half dozen treadmills, elipticals, and a few free weights. If you want a serious workout, ask about local gyms or jog along the bay. The grounds were nicely landscaped and the place was very clean.The hotel is minutes from the mall, Old Town, and the aforementioned freeway will start you on the way to Balboa Park. The freeway near Balboa is narrow and congested at times, particularly when the zoo closes and the downtown workforce heads home. Plan on traffic issues.There are many places to eat in the area--ask at the desk. Old Town is nearby, but there are also cheaper fast food places.","6":"Stayed several nights in June 2012.

The room numbers are too small to read and not reflective so impossible to see.

The room was smaller than I expected since it had two beds. One bed was up against the window pressed right up on the a/c unit. The curtains were so long they hung over the a/c unit. When I turned it on the air flow blew directly behind the curtain trapping the air flow. I had to MacGyver some decorative pillows to keep the curtains flat to let the air flow into the room. There is only 1 plug by the sink. You can not have a hair appliance plugged in and the refrigerator at the same time. Your choice of cold food and drinks or groomed hair. The room was clean. I do not like the way they charge my room to my debit card. They charge your room rate with the incidentals charge at check in and then charge your room rate again at check out. I checked in on a Friday night. The extra charges came off when I checked my account again on Tuesday. An inconvenience if you are on a tight budget and using a debit card.

But it was great to have keys in hand within less than 7 minutes. My issue with this place have to do with:1) no parking 2) how my husband and I had to walk from one end of the parking lot to the other end to get to our room. (I'm pregnant btw, to give you more context). It seemed like there were way too many cars for the number of rooms.3) The bed sufficed though it was hard. We both passed out so it didn't matter too much. 4) The AC worked. But it sounded like the people upstairs were running the shower all morning. 5) There is no tub. It's a stand in shower like in gyms. Not that that mattered to me. But water got all over the floor and you may want to bring sandals to stand in. I have a Best Western rewards card. So I stayed here to earn points. But, note to self: won't be staying here for an extended stay.

I was wary of it based on some negative reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. Check in was easy, and they let us add a day to the end of our stay at a discounted rate. The room was clean and included a mini fridge and coffee maker. We had the queen suite, which includes a bedroom and a separate living area with a pull out sofa. It included two full bathrooms, both with showers. I showered at different times each morning and always had plenty of hot water. I was apprehensive about using the pullout sofa so I brought a blowup twin mattress, and there was plenty of space for it. The only kind of gross thing was that there were a couple of hairs in the obviously otherwise clean pillowcases - I attributed these to belonging to the housekeeping staff. We asked for more linens and got them within 20 minutes.The room entrances are all outside off the parking lot, but I never felt unsafe as others have mentioned. The door had two secure locks which I used, but I never saw anyone hanging around during my stay that made me feel nervous about security. I did not hear excessive noise, but then again I sleep with ear plugs, so who knows. Nothing noticeable while I was awake. The washers and dryers were nice to have - you will need quarters and there is no change machine. The pool looked nice although I did not use it. The on-site diner-type restaurant was a little pricey, but the food was good. Room service is available until 10PM.All in all it was a pleasant stay. I would not stay there again for Comic-Con, as I realized it would be more convenient to stay downtown, but in general it's a fine motel in a good location.","6":"I stayed at this motel from 7/11 - 7/16 2012 for Comic-Con.

The internet was terrible. It would go in and out the entire time. As we were checking out, we wanted to microwave some food and were told the guest microwave was broken. We asked if there was another microwave we could use and were told the only one the guests could use was broken. Also, I've stayed in my fair share of hotels, and when I've booked through the hotel directly, as I did for this trip, I never had to pay the full amount upon check-in. I would pay a deposit and then be charged this full amount upon check-out. But here, I had to pay for the room, plus a deposit when I checked in. I thought that was weird. When we got into the room, it was hot and muggy. The A/C hadn't been turned on before our arrival (something I thought was common practice). Thankfully, we had our own fan to use while we waited for the A/C to kick in. Also, the fridge had been unplugged, so we had to wait to use that as well. I don't know if they don't clean very well or what, but the entire time I was in the hotel room, my allergies acted up. I've traveled to San Diego many times and stayed in various hotels and never before were my allergies affected until this time. Also, the last night of the trip, the fire alarm started chriping with a low battery every 30 secs starting around 5am or so. The best thing about the hotel was its location, but I couldn't see myself coming here again. It was in Hotel Circle, so I could throw a rock and hit another hotel I could stay in.Dear Lytrell M.,Thank you for taking the time to review our property and for being our guest. We are glad that you appreciated our convenient location. Based on your reservation details, we see that you booked an Internet Only special rate. For that reason, a full deposit restriction is mandated with this special discounted rate. Also, to prevent fraudulent transactions, and to cover any incidentals incurred during the guests stay, a valid credit card is required to be presented upon check-in. We do apologize for any confusion and for not being able to extend your late check-out request any further than 12:30 pm. Late check-outs are a courtesy for our guests and are based on our occupancy. We apologize for failing to meet your expectations and would be happy to host your next visit to San Diego and provide you with an excellent stay given the chance.

We opened all the windows but it took several days for the smell to disappear. Ceilings are extremely thin and so you hear anyone walking around upstairs well into the late hours of the night. Every morning, we found broken glass in the parking lot, probably from a late night patron of the breakfast joint next door. For 240 bucks per night, I would have expected far less problems. I shared these issues with the front desk and they said they would put us in an upstairs room on our next visit. This is obviously an old motel turned into a Best Western.

She was not phased at all, went online and found some AMAZING options within 10 minutes drive from the hotel. This is the hotel you want to stay in if you want to visit wineries that are still open after 4pm. The hotel rooms were huge with loads of space and big beds. More importantly there is a hot tub and pool that closes at 10pm. So after a day in the sun, it is a fantastic option. The hotel has a Denny's attached but also an iHOP within 2 minutes walk across the road. However, the hotel offers a substantial breakfast 'snack' of yogurt, cereal bars, fruit, tea, coffee and juice. Again, thank you Nicole for your professionalism, beautiful smile and calm approach!

If you book enough in advance the prices are in line with the cheaper cost hotels. All BW hotels have decent beds, bathrooms, come with microwave and fridge with a good TV and channels. The housekeeping staff does a good job with the cleaning. They do not offer breakfast, but they do give Denny's breakfast vouchers and they offer a go bag in the morning with an apple, a granola bar, and a small water. I'm usually in too much of a hurry to get to Disneyland to where breakfast doesn't matter anyways. The Stovall's BW is a few hotels closer, but is usually a little more and they charge for parking, but they have a full breakfast. Both are good to stay in. The BW on Ball Rd is nice too, but the walk is further.","6":"I stay here due to the proximity to Disneyland, it's a quick walk to the parks, and because I get the Best Western rewards.

A large part of my disappoint I will blame on Travelocity, I'm pretty sure I was booking a Best Western that was 'right across' from Disneyland and with the inflated price, I was sure of it. When I arrived I of course expressed my concern to the Front Desk and they happily called the other Best Western to see if there was avail, but there was not. They very kind and down to earth front desk clerk checked us in early (9:30AM on a Monday) and we got a 1st floor room very close to the lobby, which I would actually recommend. The room: beds were pretty comfy, bed linens were soft, pillows were plentiful, towels could have been better but did the job. There was a fridge and coffee pot in the room along with a hair dryer. AC unit was a bit loud but when we came back to the room for naps, it didn't bother us one bit. I can't complain much about the room itself --nothing went wrong or was out of place. The location: Here is where I'll get picky. I would not recommend walking to the park with little ones from here. You have to cross a majorly busy intersection, then walk through the Cast Member parking lot (finally found a safe walking area inside). This will bring you to the end of Downtown Disney, from here you can either take the Monorail to Tomorrowland or walk what would be another 'block' to the Main Entrance. I would not do this at night time! Good thing is there is an ART shuttle right in front of the property. I swear by these ART shuttles, 5/day for a shuttle to the front of the parks and runs every 20 mins. Again a positive thing about our room location is that we were able to just open our room door and keep an eye out for the shuttle and then run to it. Long story short, I overpaid on Travelocity, even after considering the location mix up. But the staff is remarkable so it made up for it.","6":"Stayed here in July booked with Travelocity.

The hotel lobby is located at the front of the property next to the high carport. The lobby looks beautiful, clean, and organized. This is where you get the grab and go breakfast. They do not have a continental breakfast, however you can get a brown paper bag and fill it with granola bars, juice boxes, fruit, yogurt, and pre-packaged pastries. There is also a business center here with two computers and a printer where you can print anything you need for your trip. They also have bathrooms for you to use when you check in. The property also has high-speed free Internet which works very well in the rooms. We stayed in room 204 which is at the back of the property, and our Internet connection was very strong. Check-in time is 3:00 pm and check-out time is 12:00 pm. The hotel is 100 smoke free. If you smoke in the rooms you will be charged 250/night extra. They have free parking and will give you a parking pass for your vehicle when you check-in. Part of the charge when you check-in is a 5/day resort fee. This is a mandatory fee that almost all hotels have. The taxes on the room are 17. The hotel is not pet friendly so don't bring your pet. The property is divided into two buildings the front building is the main building. This is where the laundromat is located on the second floor. The laundromat is open from 9 am-9 pm every day. It costs 2.00 to wash and 2.00 to dry your clothes. The gym is located in the main building next to the laundromat on the second floor. It is open from 8 am-10pm. The main building has an elevator to take you to the second floor. The second building does not have an elevator. The main building has a soda vending machine and ice machine by the elevator on the ground floor. The vending machines here take credit cards and cash as payment. The back building has a soda vending machine, snack vending machine and ice machine in the middle of the building on the ground floor. You can only use cash. Every few doors you will see garbage cans. The property is very neat and clean. There are a lot of plants so it looks lush. The pool is open from 8:00am-10:00pm. The pool is heated and it has a jacuzzi. The pool area is well maintained (cleaned everyday) with a lot of plants around it. It also has a small cabana with a table and chairs and a few umbrella tables with chairs. There is also a vending machine here. Entrances to the rooms are external meaning your door is outside. It's not inside the building. Our room was 204. It is located in the middle of the back building in front of the stairs. It is not a bad room however you can hear the people outside when they are going up the stairs. If you are sensitive to noise, this would not be a good room for you. However, if you're not this room is pretty good since it's located right next to the exit. You can see the Disneyland fireworks from this hotel and the sound they make is loud. So if you have little ones be aware of this. The property is very well lit which can be a problem depending on how you sleep. There is a light right outside our room that is able to shine through the blinds. This took a little getting used. They also have a security officer walking the property at night for your safety. As soon as you walk into the room, you will see a big flat screen HD-TV in front of you atop a 3 drawer dresser. The satellite provider is DirecTV. The pictures crisping clear with very vibrant colors. In front of the TV is the first of the double beds. The bed was nicely set with four very plush pillow's and one body pillow. The bed was firm and very comfortable for me. However depending on how you like your beds depends on how you would like this bed. I slept very comfortably. On the nightstand in between the 2 beds is a small alarm clock and a lamp. In front of the second bed and next to the TV, is a small table/desk. On top of this table is a small data box where you can plug in any of your mobile devices or laptop. It has USB ports and power outlets to charge your devices. On either side of the table, there are plush seats to sit in. They are pretty comfortable. There is also a floor lamp to light up this area. Next to the table and chairs is a small closet that protrudes from the wall. Located inside of this small closet is the ironing board, iron, suitcase stand, and hangers for your clothes. Next to the closet is the countertop where the huge mirror, sink, box of tissue, hand soaps, microwave, single serve coffee maker with packets of tea, coffee, and hot chocolate are located. The mini fridge is located underneath this counter along with an extra towel and the hair dryer. This is now the back wall of the room. The A/C unit is located along this back wall. It is pretty high up on the wall but it has a remote that you can use without having to touch the A/C unit. This is a great feature. The water from the sink takes a good minute to start warming up. There is no safe in the room. Finally the bathroom. The bathroom is small just like in all of the other hotels and it was in good condition. When you flush the toilet, it flushes quick with some strong force. The shower on the other hand has low pressure. To operate it, the handle has 2 knobs. The first knob is round and you rotate it to turn the water on. The second knob has a tab on it and this controls the temperature of the water. Just rotate it to the left or right depending on your comfort level of the water temperature. To get the water to come out of the shower head, pull the little knob that is on the water spout out. They give you towels for 4 people.Thank you for your stay with us at the Best Western Plus Pavilions. We are pleased to know you enjoyed your stay with us. We hope to see you on future trips to the Anaheim area.","6":"The hotel is located on the southeast corner of Walnut and West Katella (opposite of the Disneyland property on the Disneyland hotel side, to the right of the Denny's restaurant). The hotel lobby is located at the front of the property next to the high carport. The lobby looks beautiful, clean, and organized. This is where you get the grab and go breakfast. They do not have a continental breakfast, however you can get a brown paper bag and fill it with granola bars, juice boxes, fruit, yogurt, and pre-packaged pastries. There is also a business center here with two computers and a printer where you can print anything you need for your trip. They also have bathrooms for you to use when you check in. The property also has high-speed free Internet which works very well in the rooms. We stayed in room 204 which is at the back of the property, and our Internet connection was very strong. Check-in time is 3:00 pm and check-out time is 12:00 pm. The hotel is 100 smoke free. If you smoke in the rooms you will be charged 250/night extra. They have free parking and will give you a parking pass for your vehicle when you check-in. Part of the charge when you check-in is a 5/day resort fee. This is a mandatory fee that almost all hotels have. The taxes on the room are 17. The hotel is not pet friendly so don't bring your pet. The property is divided into two buildings the front building is the main building. This is where the laundromat is located on the second floor. The laundromat is open from 9 am-9 pm every day. It costs 2.00 to wash and 2.00 to dry your clothes. The gym is located in the main building next to the laundromat on the second floor. It is open from 8 am-10pm. The main building has an elevator to take you to the second floor. The second building does not have an elevator. The main building has a soda vending machine and ice machine by the elevator on the ground floor. The vending machines here take credit cards and cash as payment. The back building has a soda vending machine, snack vending machine and ice machine in the middle of the building on the ground floor. You can only use cash. Every few doors you will see garbage cans. The property is very neat and clean. There are a lot of plants so it looks lush. The pool is open from 8:00am-10:00pm. The pool is heated and it has a jacuzzi. The pool area is well maintained (cleaned everyday) with a lot of plants around it. It also has a small cabana with a table and chairs and a few umbrella tables with chairs. There is also a vending machine here. Entrances to the rooms are external meaning your door is outside. It's not inside the building. Our room was 204. It is located in the middle of the back building in front of the stairs. It is not a bad room however you can hear the people outside when they are going up the stairs. If you are sensitive to noise, this would not be a good room for you. However, if you're not this room is pretty good since it's located right next to the exit. You can see the Disneyland fireworks from this hotel and the sound they make is loud. So if you have little ones be aware of this. The property is very well lit which can be a problem depending on how you sleep. There is a light right outside our room that is able to shine through the blinds. This took a little getting used. They also have a security officer walking the property at night for your safety. As soon as you walk into the room, you will see a big flat screen HD-TV in front of you atop a 3 drawer dresser. The satellite provider is DirecTV. The pictures crisping clear with very vibrant colors. In front of the TV is the first of the double beds. The bed was nicely set with four very plush pillow's and one body pillow. The bed was firm and very comfortable for me. However depending on how you like your beds depends on how you would like this bed. I slept very comfortably. On the nightstand in between the 2 beds is a small alarm clock and a lamp. In front of the second bed and next to the TV, is a small table/desk. On top of this table is a small data box where you can plug in any of your mobile devices or laptop. It has USB ports and power outlets to charge your devices. On either side of the table, there are plush seats to sit in. They are pretty comfortable. There is also a floor lamp to light up this area.

It was never crowded and often we were t he only people riding. As far as the rooms go they were on par with other places I have stayed in the area.

I didn't have the breakfast so I can't comment on that.I am trying to book a place for an upcoming weekend in the UCF area and I guess I'm gonna go with this place again, although I'd rather find someplace else.

I have reviewed a lot of hotels and I rarely leave a bad review, but this was too disgusting to not address.We were moving my cousin to Orlando, and needed a late night hotel last minute. We picked the best western, in hind sight I wish we had slept in the car. We checked in around 1 am. Once we got settled in and ready for bed, we started seeing small roaches crawling out from behind the painting above our bed. My husband killed the 2 that we saw. We were a little grossed out but that late at night, we didn't have many options. The next morning we woke up to more roaches crawling around the painting. Then we saw a couple of huge ones above the TV. After seeing this we wondered how many more were in the room. We grabbed our stuff went to front desk and told them. She refunded us 50 . My husband emailed the manager STUART BLOOMBERG about this. He emailed us back and told us the exterminators came and said the room was perfectly clean and there wasn't a single roach. So either we saw the only 4 roaches in the room or someone is not being honest. My husband relayed to Stuart how grossed out we were and asked for the remainder of balance to be refunded. Stuart told us he can't do that the roaches must have entered the room when we opened the door to enter the room ourselves. At this point not only were we disgusted by the pest infested room but also insulted by the manager that he would accuse us of letting the roaches in. We are realistic, a bug here and there is normal, but a roach infested room is a sign of filth. We are so disappointed, what a waste of money, and such poor customer service. STAURT BLOOMBERG offered us 50 off on our next stay, as if we would EVER go back to that hotel. I have never left a hotel feeling this disgusted. A word of advice to the manager of this hotel, don't blame your customers for your hotels lack of hygiene. Unprofessional staff, filthy hotel, stay somewhere else.Dear Deepti DI really appreciate you taking the time to share your disappointment with your recent stay. I want to personally apologize again as did my staff did for the failure in our extermination program.

When telling taxi drivers where you are staying, you may have to refer to it as the Windsor Inn or Sleep Inn. The confusion in names made it difficult for the airline to return a piece of lost baggage, since they didn't have the new name in their computer system. We booked our room on www.hotels.ca and got a room with 2 double beds for 49/night.I stayed here on October 18-21 to visit Universal Studios and do some shopping prior to a conference at the Orange County Convention Centre. As two female travelers, we felt safe and enjoyed the many perks of staying at this hotel. LOCATION: This hotel has a fantastic location! It's located right off I-Drive, and there is an I-Trolley stop right across the street. You can easily reach both outlet malls on the I-Trolley. There is a shuttle that takes guests to Universal Studios, SeaWorld and Disneyworld. They drop-off in the morning, and return for pick-up twice in the evening. This means that you have to stay at the park for a decent amount of time. The shuttle is quick and pain-free.BREAKFAST: The breakfasts are fantastic. It is hectic around 8:30 AM when everybody is getting ready to visit the theme-parks. This makes breakfast a rather rushed affair since there are limited tables, and it is not always desirable to sit outside because of the weather. The buffet consisted of: pancakes, bacon/sausage, eggs, pastries, oranges, and juice. Of course, all of the jam included corn syrup, as did the pancake syrup. There are whole-wheat English muffins.THEME PARK TICKETS: There is a person who sells tickets to the theme parks at a 'discount.' After talking to him, I determined that purchasing from his is not that different from purchasing online. He sells Universal Studios 2-day park-to-park passes for 130 cash, or 135 with a credit card. He also had Disneyworld tickets for 30 off, however, this only applied with a group of three or more, and this was with a special 'employee voucher,' for which you had to notify him one day in advance, and go with him to the park to purchase the tickets. From my observations of his interactions with other guests, he didn't seem particularly keen to garner business, so I would probably look around for better deals.AMENITIES: The rooms were simple, but great. They hotel is newly renovated, and each has a safe. Although the bathroom had a funky odour, I think this is more likely attributed to the smell in Orlando's tap water, rather than hotel cleanliness.STAFF: I cannot describe how wonderful the staff were. We were greeted by Derek, who directed us to our room, and provided suggestions on where to eat. We also met another staff member named Derek, who was most courteous and helpful. There was no problem stowing our luggage with the desk since we went to a theme park after checking out... however, I was rather shocked that they did not ask for any ID to make sure that we were the owners when picking up our luggage afterwards.OVERALL: A wonderful hotel, and a great way to save money, particularly with a family. There's a pool and gym, and this provides a simple and affordable, yet comfortable place to relax while in Orlando.","6":"This hotel has recently been renamed the Best Western Plus.

OVERALL: A wonderful hotel, and a great way to save money, particularly with a family. There's a pool and gym, and this provides a simple and affordable, yet comfortable place to relax while in Orlando.","7":["Orange County Convention Centre","affordable, yet comfortable place","two female travelers","wheat English muffins","special 'employee voucher","THEME PARK TICKETS","theme parks","taxi drivers","Windsor Inn","Sleep Inn","new name","computer system","2 double beds","Universal Studios","many perks","outlet malls","decent amount","limited tables","corn syrup","pancake syrup","credit card","funky odour","tap water","great way","day park","park passes","fantastic location","I-Trolley stop","other guests","hotel cleanliness","staff member","wonderful hotel","Disneyworld tickets","confusion","names","airline","piece","baggage","room","www","hotels","49/night","October","shopping","conference","I-Drive","street","shuttle","SeaWorld","morning","pick","evening","time","BREAKFAST","8:30 AM","everybody","theme-parks","affair","weather","buffet","pancakes","bacon/sausage","eggs","pastries","oranges","juice","jam","person","discount","purchasing","130 cash","group","advance","observations","interactions","business","deals","AMENITIES","safe","smell","Orlando","Derek","suggestions","problem","luggage","desk","ID","owners","money","family","pool","gym","simple"],"8":"mixed"},{"0":"warren","1":"28.4193","2":"-81.4644","3":"Best Western Orlando Convention Center Hotel","4":"4","5":"short walk to seaworld .there also was a shuttle available.I bought my tickets right in the lobby one of the staff gave me a coupon for free drinks at Delmonico restaurant . excellent!! great steakhouse.","6":"short walk to seaworld .there also was a shuttle available.

You are right there to see all the beautiful homes of the Garden District and to visit Magazine street. The hotel itself is so accommodating. The breakfast is bountiful - hot and cold items, and lots of fresh fruit. They keep coffee, tea and fresh-fruit-flavored chilled water available all day. In the afternoon they put out warm, fresh-baked cookies. In the evening, there are grapes and cheese. All on the house! There is a decent-enough and very friendly Mexican-style restaurant and lounge attached. We ate there our first evening and cannot complain. What is nice, once again, is that the restaurant is a bit loud, but we never heard it from our room. Everything about this hotel is great.

Especially during Mardi Gras, when this area is near parade routes, but even at other times, this hotel is more expensive than the Best Western St. Christopher (on the edge of the French Quarter). I think the biggest difference between the two is the location that you prefer. I don't want to pay more to stay in the Garden District, but I could think of people who would.Rooms. These are a little smaller than normal and don't have work desks or in-room safes. My room faced the parking lot behind the hotel and was fairly quiet. On previous visits I didn't have a problem with noise either. I love the room decor which is bright and contemporary. It looks better than most BWs I've visited. Also, there is an extra sink next to the closet space near the door, which works well when there are multiple people in a room.Location. It is on St. Charles with a streetcar stop almost in front of the hotel. St. Charles and its nearby areas have more good restaurants than the French Quarter IMO and the streetcar is an incredibly efficient way of getting to them. Also, the French Quarter is not walking distance from the hotel, but the streetcar takes you to Canal Street, which is the border of the Quarter. The hotel is also quite close to Loyola and Tulane Universities as well as Audubon Park/Zoo. This particular area of St. Charles is residential. It should be noted that part of the hotel is built on top of a restaurant, Superior Grill. This is convenient, but it enhances the possibility for noise. It hasn't bothered me, but I've never been in a room directly over it.Cleanliness. The room was reasonably clean. I was there for a half-marathon and spent more time than normal in the bathroom to ice my legs. I noticed that the bathroom wasn't exactly spotless, but it wasn't anything you'd notice unless you spent 30-45 minutes in there looking around. Service. The front desk staff struck me as nice, but in a couple of cases simply weren't able to accommodate me. I arrived around 3:15PM and my room was not ready. Since the hotel was fully booked, they couldn't give me another room. I waited in the lobby for a little more than an hour and two calls by the clerk to the housekeeper and my room still wasn't ready. The clerk agreed to hold my bag while I went next door to Superior Grill to eat dinner. I returned about 6:30PM and my room was ready. I was not the only person waiting for a room. (Throughout my stay, I noticed that housekeeping seemed to occur late in the day, about 1-4 PM. It wasn't difficult to notice because the housekeeper on our floor blasted music in the rooms she was cleaning.) Second, I asked the front desk for some information about street closures occurring that weekend and they weren't aware of them. It's a relatively minor issue, but there were multiple people asking and they never got answers.Sleep Quality. My room was quiet and the bed relatively decent.Notes. The surface on the second floor slopes a bit which can feel weird initially.

I was very disappointed.My reservation for this stay was confirmed in January 2014. It was prepaid, and the charge was posted to my credit card account on 10 January last. I selected the hotel partly for its location, partly because it offered the facilities and amenities I sought, and partly because of good reviews on TripAdvisor.When we arrived at the hotel on 7 October, the lady on the front counter told me the MasterCard I presented was declined, and requested another card. Since I knew there was nothing wrong with my card or account, I stood my ground. Reluctantly she tried again, and succeeded. But that was clearly not her first choice.I told her the reservation was prepaid, which she denied. She said it would be charged to my card.

What it does not say is that there are only 40 or 41 spaces, given out on a first come first served basis. When we arrived they had all been given out. Because we were staying two nights I was permitted to park on the street in front of the hotel, rather than off-site (the other option). Neither of those options fits what I understand when a hotel advertises free parking. (I was given access to the hotel's parking area for our second night.)When we reached our room we were very disappointed at its size. There was neither room nor a stand to open two suitcases one case occupied the armchair, leaving only the desk chair for seating. This does not conform with what I expect from a Best Western, let alone a Best Western Plus hotel. And at 161 per night I consider it over-priced, though most hotels of this standard in New Orleans seem to charge around this figure.On both mornings we were at the hotel, when I stepped into the bath to shower there appeared black grime on the bath from my feet this came from the carpet. I complained the first morning and asked that the floor be vacuumed, but the problem was still there the second morning. I consider that the carpet in that room requires a shampoo.Finally, on both mornings when we came to breakfast the four tables provided were all fully used. On the first morning we had our breakfast in the Business Centre on the second morning we waited until other guests left.On the morning of our departure there appeared under the door a statement which, in the light of the initial denial that the reservation was prepaid, could have meant that the hotel had charged the stay to my credit card on the day of my arrival. The lady at the front desk on departure morning clarified that, though I must say bringing a January payment into the hotels account on 7 October seems a strange way to keep books. But the total of this statement exceeded my prepayment by 4.92, and appeared to say this amount was charged to my card on departure. I hope and expect that no attempt is made to recover this amount. A prepaid room is fully prepaid if the hotels charges change between when the stay is prepaid and when the guests arrive, that is the hotels risk. After all, they had my money for nine months. It is not a charge that can legitimately be passed on to the customer.Bruxin,I appreciate you taking time to let us know about the issues you had with the hotel. I am very sorry about the confusion with the prepayment. We just switched out front desk system, and they have been working on it for about a week and a half! The system is not playing well with out credit card swipers causing declines, so we have new ones on order. I have refunded the 4.92 to your credit card.

The city implemented a tourism assessment in April causing the difference in your bill.

The hotel staff were super nice and efficient, especially Jeana at the front desk and Tatum in house keeping. The lobby is great with a very nice and plentiful breakfast, as well as snacks midday and coffee or lemon infused water all day! Our room was super clean and could not have been nicer, plus having two separate vanities/sinks really spoiled us. There was even a window in the bathroom for FRESH air. We found the French Quarters to be dirty and intimidating at times (so many homeless), so being in this area was another plus...surrounded by beautiful homes, trolley across the street, a few blocks from the Fresh Market grocery and the best bonus of all was the grassy park right next door which came in handy for those late night/early morning potty breaks for our dog. I am so glad that we were unable to find a pet friendly hotel WITH GRASS in the Quarters as we would have been so unhappy and absolutely loved our stay here, and this location for half the price also!! One more thing is parking...it was free and gated They gave us a remote control so we could come and go as we pleased knowing we would always have a free parking space waiting for us at the end of the day. Never saw a manager, but did not need to. Everything ran smooth and efficient. Good job!!","6":"For a 3Star Hotel, we could not have been any happier with our selection!

There were many pros and a few cons. First the pros - the price was great and parking was FREE. Yes, you read that correctly. FREE. Very few hotels in New Orleans have free parking. The parking was also secured. Hotel staff were fantastic - all were very friendly and eager to please their guests. The location was terrific - on St.Charles Avenue. You could sit outside on the small patio and watch the streetcar go by. Great place for people watching too. Excellent Tex-Mex restaurant next door. The hotel is small, so not so many people that you get lost in the crowd. Breakfast was outstanding. Lots of choices for a small hotel. It was also quiet. I particularly liked the reading library loan option on my floor (2nd) and enjoyed a John Grisham novel while I was staying there. There were only a few cons - my room was musty and seemed damp. The elevator was broken while I was there, but the hotel staff did offer to carry my bags up and down. I'm planning another trip to NOLA in the near future and will go back to see if things have improved a bit.Thank you for taking the time to review our property.

This was especially true, when our room had mold on the windows and drapes and smelled of damp. We were immediately moved to the only other available room, which, unfortunately also had mold (this time in bathroom) and damp. It was supposed to be a more expensive room because it overlooked St Charles Street, which under cover of night seems to have lots of inebriated individuals and street pharmacists doing business. We couldn't use the elevator for a short time after the ceiling fell in on another guest and had to be repaired. The bed was comfortable and would have contributed to a good nights sleep except for the damp smell. Both the room we started with and the room we eventually slept in were a bit small for two twin beds and a family of four with teenagers.The staff made sure the rest of our four-night reservation was cancelled and let us keep our car in the secured parking lot while we explored the French Quarter the next day even after we had checked out. They were helpful despite our unpleasant stay due circumstances beyond their control. Because of the helpfulness and friendliness of the front desk staff, I wish that I could give this hotel a higher rating, but as we could not even stay past the first night of our reservation (and then only because it was late and dark and we had no other place to go), I could not recommend this hotel.David,I'm very sorry we did not exceed your expectations during your stay. The issues you encountered have been addressed by housekeeping. We have rooms with two double beds and one king bed. I'm sorry the room with two double beds seemed small for your family. I hope your time in New Orleans was enjoyable and you were able to see a lot while site-seeing after you checked out. We always want to accommodate our guests by letting them their cars with us a little longer!Again, I am very sorry you did not enjoy your stay.

We were greeted by very nice people, and I was overjoyed to see a lighted make-up mirror in the room since I was in town for a Wedding. The room was beautiful and the neighborhood was wonderful. With the trolley right outside we were able to jump into the French Quarter or go the opposite way to enjoy a stroll in the park very easily. The breakfast was delicious and during the day you can also munch on cheese and grapes. The staff was terrific, and extremely nice to everyone. I cannot say enough good things about this sweet hotel... but to say I will definitely stay here again when I return to Louisiana.Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel Val!

We appreciate your honest remarks. We are so sorry you had a few odd incidents during your stay. Unfortunately, there are some things that we cannot control. Our parking lot can get a little tight, especially during sold out nights. Many guests with larger vehicles choose to park on the street for that reason. The area that we are in is generally a safe business/residential area and fortunately, we have not had any negative reports from people who have chosen to park on the street. We do warn guests that early Tuesday mornings, street sweeping takes place and tickets are given to anyone parked during those hours. As far as the shampoo dispensers go, we have found a solution to this problem and are currently taking care of it so that it does not continue to be an issue.

For the first time, Trip Advisor has let us down. I find it impossible to believe that the Lamplighter is the second-highest rated hotel in all of San Diego!It is not great value for the money it is simply an inexpensive motel, with nothing special or remarkable to recommend it. It is located on a busy street in a marginal neighborhood. The lush landscaping of the grounds consists of a few palm trees dotting the parking lot which makes up most of the site, and a patch of grass by the small pool (separated from the parking lot by only an iron fence). We booked a room with a kitchen because it happened to be the best rate available. The room was large in area, but so badly laid out and drearily decorated that it felt cramped and depressing (the kitchen was a total waste of space, especially since it wasn't stocked with cookware or dishes- the cupboards and drawers were completely empty). The furniture was ugly and drab. The room was not well sound-proofed each time our upstairs neighbors took a step, it sounded like elephants were marching across the ceiling. The bathroom was fortunately very clean, but the polyester-blend bath towels were thin and not very absorbent, and left a flurry of lint everywhere. The complimentary breakfast did feature a good selection of pastries, cereals, waffles, juices and fruit, but the pastries were stale and tasteless and the coffee (in styrofoam cups) was bad.The Lamplighter is by no means a dump or a dive it was clean, and the one staff member we dealt with on check-in and check-out was polite and efficient. But it does not by any stretch of the imagination deserve the inflated rating it now enjoys on TripAdvisor.Dear Valued Guest, Thank you for your review about your recent stay at our hotel. We appreciate hearing from all of our guests. These reviews show us not only our areas of strength, but also the areas in which we can improve. TripAdvisor measures only one thing, guest satisfaction. It is not a measure of luxury or location. On TripAdvisor, an economy hotel can score very well and a luxury hotel can score poorly. It is clearly displayed on TripAdvisor that our hotel class is a 2-star (were a AAA 2-diamond property), with amenities and prices that reflect that rating. There definitely are hundreds of luxurious hotels in San Diego to choose from, but at a much higher cost and possibly a lower level of guest satisfaction. Our rating on TripAdvisor is a byproduct of our single-minded dedication to consistent service, quality, and value. We are proud of the ambiance we have created with the space we have available to us. We definitely dont have the grounds that a larger hotel might have, but we have taken great effort to fill our space with colorful plants, flowers, vines, and many lovely palm trees. Its an expense many mid-market hotels arent willing to incur. Regarding your room, it is a kitchen layout that is very popular with many guests staying for long periods as they have full size appliances and plenty of counter space. While none of them are stocked, we do provide full kitchen packs upon request. We do this to protect our guests. We have learned from experience that by keeping the kits in a sealed container, we can ensure that when a new guest arrives, the kit they receive will be clean, complete and in good condition. Im sorry this was not explained to you. Our company culture is to provide outstanding customer service, quality and value to our guests. We manage two hotels in San Diego, we are proud that both are in the top 15 on TripAdvisor. Thank you again for your review. We do appreciate the comments. Sincerely,John LyonProud Owner, Best Western Lamplighter Inn","6":"We've just returned from a one-night stay at the Lamplighter, which we chose based upon the TripAdvisor reviews and rating. For the first time, Trip Advisor has let us down. I find it impossible to believe that the Lamplighter is the second-highest rated hotel in all of San Diego! It is not great value for the money it is simply an inexpensive motel, with nothing special or remarkable to recommend it. It is located on a busy street in a marginal neighborhood. The lush landscaping of the grounds consists of a few palm trees dotting the parking lot which makes up most of the site, and a patch of grass by the small pool (separated from the parking lot by only an iron fence). We booked a room with a kitchen because it happened to be the best rate available. The room was large in area, but so badly laid out and drearily decorated that it felt cramped and depressing (the kitchen was a total waste of space, especially since it wasn't stocked with cookware or dishes- the cupboards and drawers were completely empty). The furniture was ugly and drab. The room was not well sound-proofed each time our upstairs neighbors took a step, it sounded like elephants were marching across the ceiling. The bathroom was fortunately very clean, but the polyester-blend bath towels were thin and not very absorbent, and left a flurry of lint everywhere. The complimentary breakfast did feature a good selection of pastries, cereals, waffles, juices and fruit, but the pastries were stale and tasteless and the coffee (in styrofoam cups) was bad. The Lamplighter is by no means a dump or a dive it was clean, and the one staff member we dealt with on check-in and check-out was polite and efficient.

The Lamplighter, while an older hotel, is very well maintained and super clean. It's third generation American family owned. The landscaping is lush, the breakfast is more than a continental and very tasty. The team spirit among the employees and staff was most noticeable.

Although it has a 'motel' look (two story buildings with outside doors) it is well maintained and has well kept grass, plants and flowers which give it a more friendly feel. There is a small but clean pool which is set up with beach chairs with towels on them for your convenience. There is a nice little breakfast set up (pastries, bagels, cereal and make your own waffles) served until 10am every morning. Its a great way to start the day and save a bit of money on food. We stayed in a suite which was very spacious (small sitting room with a pullout couch and then an attached room with a nice sided bed) and perfect for me, my husband and our young son (there's no door between the rooms - so don't look for privacy). One of the best features is Len - a member of staff at the hotel. He is very friendly, seems to know most everyone by their name and is a fount of information. We checked in daily with him for the scoop on things we were considering seeing. The only downside to the hotel is the location. Its not terrible - but its not a 'walking' friendly place. There are a lot of little local shops (drug stores, nail salons, that sort of thing) but nothing necessarily 'pretty' or tourist friendly places. That being said, it is very easy to get in a car and drive to many of main attractions of San Diego - and the staff is more than happy to give you driving information to them. Our original plan was to stay in Old Town (which after seeing we absolutely love!) but the hotels were sold out. If you're looking for a decent place to rest your head and are willing to hop in your car for short distances to get to places than I would recommend the Lamplighter.","6":"We love the Lamplighter Inn in San Diego. Although it has a 'motel' look (two story buildings with outside doors) it is well maintained and has well kept grass, plants and flowers which give it a more friendly feel. There is a small but clean pool which is set up with beach chairs with towels on them for your convenience. There is a nice little breakfast set up (pastries, bagels, cereal and make your own waffles) served until 10am every morning. Its a great way to start the day and save a bit of money on food. We stayed in a suite which was very spacious (small sitting room with a pullout couch and then an attached room with a nice sided bed) and perfect for me, my husband and our young son (there's no door between the rooms - so don't look for privacy). One of the best features is Len - a member of staff at the hotel. He is very friendly, seems to know most everyone by their name and is a fount of information.

We stayed here for five nights with our two young children and visited the zoo, Balboa Park, Sea World and Coronado during our stay. The hotel was near the zoo/Balboa Park and was a reasonable distance from Sea World and the beach. El Cajon Blvd has many ethnic (Mexican, Thai, Vietnamese, Kosher) restaurants and the usual fast food chains. We did not see any restaurant chains such as Outback, Denny's, or Chili's near the hotel. There are several grocery and drug stores nearby. We felt safe walking around the neighborhood with our kids.Our room was clean with updated bedding and furniture and had a fridge and microwave. It was not large, but adequate for our needs. We did not have any problems with noisy neighbors or noise from the street during late-night hours. The free continental breakfast was good. The only thing I found missing was yogurt. We asked for advice and directions from the front desk several times and they never led us astray. We also purchased discount zoo tickets from the front desk. We used the pool once and it was fine.I agree with another reviewer that it is just a motel. However, we spent less than 100/night here and we were happy with our choice.","6":"We chose this hotel based on its TripAdvisor reviews and we were not disappointed.

We spent 6 nights in this hotel, which we chose based on the reviews here, and were not very happy. I'll try to break in down to pros and cons:Pros:- It is a decent, well-maintained property. - Housekeeping was great, the room was very clean and the grounds are beautifully landscaped.- Breakfast was better than expected, had a wide selection and kept us (and kids) happy for the first half of the day.- Most of the staff we encountered was friendly and helpful, especially the front desk manager.Cons:- Location!! The hotel is located in a remote, not-so-good part of town (not a bad neighborhood, just a commercial street dotted with hookah lounges and pawn shops). Getting anywhere in the city took about 20 minutes drive and was quite frustrating.- The room, although spacious and comfy, does NOT contain fridge and/or microwave, which made it difficult to stay with kids.- They charge for cribs in the room - 5 per crib per night, which would add up to quite a hefty amount. We have been traveling with young kids for the past 6 years, and this is the first time we were charged for crib. On checkout, when the front desk lady asked if everything was ok, I said that I was unhappy with this extra charge - she just shrugged and said it was the manager's decision. Great.To sum it up: for families with young kids like ourselves, I'd suggest not to be tempted by the reasonable price and positive reviews, but rather pay more attention to the details and choose a hotel closer to downtown.Dear Valued Guest, Thank you for sharing your experience with the TripAdvisor community, and for choosing the Best Western Lamplighter Inn Suites.

We tend to rate highly with those who appreciate great customer service, clean rooms and want the most for their dollar. While we do charge 5 for a crib, we also include many free amenities that you may end up having to pay for in more expensive hotels, including those in the downtown area. We offer free wireless internet, free parking, free coffee and tea all day, DVD players in all guestrooms, a thoughtfully selected free movie library, and a complimentary expanded continental breakfast that includes much more substance than a standard continental breakfast, we offer hard-boiled eggs, steel-cut oatmeal, freshly made bagels and pastries, juices and make-your-own-waffles. As you mentioned, the hotel property is very well maintained, with clean, lush, and beautifully landscaped grounds. The guestrooms are spotless, as well as spacious and comfy.

We do have rooms equipped with microwaves and mini-fridges, as well as rooms with efficiency kitchens. Next time you stay, please feel free to ask for a room with a refrigerator or a full kitchen.

Being close to the University, we are also in close proximity to many great restaurants and eclectic coffee shops.

It looked like they really tried to give a garden feel to it with hanging succulents and different plants all around. I arrived at 11, too early to check in but they let me park in their lot for the 15 (wish it were included),. The parking area is small but backing in helps. I have a Jeep Cherokee and had no problems. The room was small but clean and cute. I was there for a bachelorette party and fake diamond rings were hidden around the room, so I can attest to the cleanliness since 9 girls looked for rings in almost every inch of the room. One downside of the hotel was being woken up a couple different times by sirens and honking but it is the downtown area. Breakfast was very nice- pancakes, sausages, eggs, different breads and muffins, cereal, yogurt, granola, fruit, almond milk, teas and coffee. There was a waffle maker but I didn't see batter. The woman working in the breakfast area was very efficient and helpful. They had a nice little seating area outside and tables and seats outside some of the rooms. The hotel was walking distance to everything we did, maybe a 10 min walk. I would stay again.

The room included a complimentary hot breakfast but did not include parking. The hotel was a bit away from San Diegos centre but it was definitely within walking distance for us. If not for others, the trolley and bus stop is only a block away. The staff member at the front desk was very helpful with information regarding maps, transport, food and places to steer clear from. The nightly rate was 150USD, maybe a little pricey for what we got but we enjoyed the stay overall. We were there to see San Diego after all, not the four walls of the Best Western. Still, I would recommend this hotel if you didnt mind being just out of the very centre of the city.","6":"Had a four night stay at the Cabrillo in early May 2010.

The hotel structure itself dates to the 1800's as the very knowledgeable front desk clear explained when I inquired. She knew all the details and was very proud to share her knowledge. It certainly made for a very nice welcome at check-in (which was efficient and quick).After quickly settling in, I was off to explore the French Quarter and the hotel location on the edge of the historic district makes walking to everything quite easy, yet it's just far enough away from the nightlife to keep things quiet at night. Shops, restaurants, bars and historic sites are all around and across the street Louis Armstrong Park can be accessed a few blocks away.My room on the 2nd floor overlooked the lovely courtyard with trees, chairs to relax and an out door pool. The room was fresh and clean with comfortable beds, a pleasant bathroom with ample lighting, free Wi-Fi (easy to connect and fast speed), a refrigerator, HDTV and safe (large enough for my 14 laptop). The only item needing attention in my room was the grout in the shower, which must be a challenge in such a humid climate.Considering this is such a historic property, they have done a nice job connecting all the buildings and keeping the guest room modern yet with old world charm. Rooms face the courtyard, nearby buildings, the street - so be sure to request the view / area that most suits your needs.Although I did not take advantage of the pool, I did enjoy the complimentary breakfast in the morning. A nice mix of hot and cold options, including waffles, eggs, yogurt, cereal, etc. The staff were ever present and helpful to guests, a very positive experience. My only complaint was the oatmeal was only available using the instant packets, which is never as good as a nice hot crock often found at hotels today.In the evening, the hotel also opens the breakfast area for food and drinks, but I explored the area instead. The hotel lends itself to a relaxing escape, and I ended up meeting a couple who are regulars to the hotel and New Orleans! The best guest is a repeat one and that certainly speaks to the quality experience.While the focus appears to be leisure travelers, the hotel has everything required for a business traveler as well. If returning to New Orleans, I would certainly return again and would recommend to anyone looking for a clean, comfortable, affordable hotel with nice amenities. For meeting all my needs and the expectations of a Best Western Plus hotel, I would certainly rate my experience 5 stars.We are glad that we were able to be a nice break from your business trip and hope to see you again the next time you are in New Orleans.Thank You, Bryant Faul - General Manager","6":"On a recent business trip to New Orleans, I was able to extend my stay for an evening and in doing so, I chose to stay closer to the French Quarter (the host hotel was near the Superdome, about 1 mile away).

Overall, I'd choose this hotel over and over again! Thanks BW for a great stay! Thank you for your review. We are extremely happy to hear that you enjoyed your stay with us. We take great pride in providing excellent customer service to all of our guests.

You would have thought I would have gotten what I asked for (2 rooms side by side). When we arrived we were told we would not be on the same floor as someone who had just fronted at reception was given one of our rooms. I protested and they relented but our rooms were not side by side but quite a distance from each other. This was not good enough. The rooms themselves were nice and the hotel very good. Did have a problem with other guests walking past our door in the early morning and talking rather loudly - enough to wake us up. Also the car park directly underneath the rooms was not good. Motorbikes revving early morning is bad. Good to have computers available to guests. Breakfast was a definite bonus, with alot of variation. Would we stay again - maybe, but would look at other options.","6":"I booked our accommodation in December 2011 for April 2012.

I mean how long are you going to be in the room anyway The rooms were not huge, but they were clean and the beds were very comfortable. This is an old restored building which has lots of charm. The elevators are tiny and there is a nice courtyard with a pool and seating areas. (we were there in the winter) They offer a free continental breakfast, including eggs, sausage, biscuits and more. The bartender was friendly and very helpful with local attractions. They have free WI-FI and a small business center that makes it handy to print your boarding passes. The hotel is just a few blocks from Bourbon Street, and is far enough that you don't have to listen to all the noise. They do have an airport shuttle, BUT you must reserve it at least 24 hours in advance. If only the front desk had told us this little detail, we could have saved some money. I would stay here again on a future visit.","6":"We took a 3 day trip to New Orleans and wanted to stay close to the French Quarter without spending an arm and a leg.

It's located on the edge of the French Quarter, so you can be in the action on Bourbon Street after a five minute walk.

We were delighted to get upgraded to a suite, but really did not spend much time in the room taking advantage of the hot tub or other amenities. There is so much to see and do in town and the tour buses will pick up visitors right at the front door of the hotel. A nice bar is available for a leisurely drink and a free breakfast is offered featuring a variety of the usual fare. Parking is hard to come by in town, but it's available on site for hotel guests (for a nightly fee).

Ms BrittanyThank you for accenting our unique location, we are glad you found getting around the French Quarter convenient. I hope you change your mind about returning to our hotel, please keep my email and phone number below so I can do everything possible to assist in reserving the area of the hotel which makes you most comfortable. I want your visit to start memorable. We always want to learn and I will take more notice of bedding and check the timing of cleaning the leaves from the pool. I hope I have a chance to show you the improvements.

Very friendly staff and extremely helpful. It is located on the edge of the French Quarter but the streetcar stops just outside the front of the hotel so you can get to a lot of places. They have parking, for a charge, and we ere able to leave our car when we checked out until the afternoon. Very helpful. The pace is not new but is well cared for and build around a garden so it have a real NOLA feel to it. I'm glad we stayed there.Thank you Larry for taking the time to review our hotel. We appreciate all the kind words and are pleased to know you had a great stay. We look forward to having you the next time you visit New Orleans.","6":"I've stayed at a lot of hotels but this was one of the best. Very friendly staff and extremely helpful.

Rooms are small if your tall you may want to avoid the bathroom, the water pressure is really low and the water is kind of slimy sticks with your skin after your dry. I've stayed at other Hotels in NOLA and can't blame the water source. Parking is a bit cramped if you drive a SUV or Truck be careful. Breakfast is good for being FREE but I would rather eat at many of the great restaurants...courtyard area is nice as is the bar. they also have no security and the rooms doors face out anyone can't just walk in and out on this property. The street where the hotel sits is under major construction so lobby and bar are covered in dust. Staff of the hotel were good allowed me to check in early. Like I said Hotel was decent would not however be my first choice more of a back up plan.Thank you for choosing our hotel for your stay here in New Orleans. We need honest reviews from guest's like you in order to correct our shortcomings. The construction should be finished in late summer or early fall of this year. This streetcar line will be a great plus for this part of the French Quarter. Our water goes through a water softener which will make it feel like it is still on you after you have rinsed. We do close our gates at 11:30 each night and have a Security Officer on premises every night with only one door unlocked to access the hotel. We sure wish we could make our parking lot bigger. We would really love for you to consider us again on any future trips to New Orleans. We would love to see you again.Robert K., Manger on Duty","6":"Overall nice Hotel, nice area.

It has a nice pool located in the centre of the forecourt with plenty of loungers and tables around it. The inclusive breakfast was good and plentiful but ends at 9.30am on a weekday with extended times on the weekend. Rooms are clean and comfortable but as is fairly common now, A/C units are located in the rooms and can get very noisy at night. If it's not too warm it would be better to keep it down or turn it off as it can disturb sometimes. Overall a very nice mid range priced hotel for the location. Staff are very friendly and able to arrange the booking of various tourist attractions if required.I am pleased to hear you enjoyed our hotel and staff..

We had a courtyard room and barely had enough space for our luggage (forget about using it for 4 people). The obvious place for bags is either in front of the door (blocking it) or in between the beds. There's hardly room for your toiletries and you have to remove them if you want to make coffee. Also, the a/c is half a foot from a bed, so you have a constant cold flow over your bed.That said, the location is really good: you're just blocks away from all the fun in Bourbon Street there's a streetcar in front of the building and you are only steps away from the Armstrong park. Breakfast was rather good as well with plenty of eggs and bacon.I am sorry to hear about your experience. I hope the next time you are in New Orleans you will come back and see us.

We decided last minute to drive to the concert because of weather concerns. The concert did not end until late and when we returned to the hotel the gate was shut at the entrance. My wife ran in and asked the clerk who came out promptly and opend the gate. The parking was a little tight especially since I drive a large SUV but amazingly I had no problems parking.

The location of the room overlooked the pool and garden. The room was beautiful, well decorated. The bed was very conferable. I believe the sheets were even a high thread count . I liked the fact that is was only 3 blocks from the excitement Bourbon Street. This made it very convenient for walking. Plan on walking everyplace. There is lots to do and see. Defiantly walk to Cafe Dumont for Cafe Au Lait and a Beignets are a must. Walk along the fresh market for some fine shopping and walk along the Mighty Mississippi and look out over the water. The hotel is close enough to get to the action but far enough away that when it is time to sleep you don't have to deal with the noise. The hotel courtyard and fountain with a nice pool is a great place to be outdoors. Continental breakfast had a great variety of choices including eggs, and a pleasant dining room overlooking the courtyard and pool. Before you leave you must stop by Clover Grill on 900 Bourbon Street for the worlds best breakfast you will ever eat.

Excellent location. The hotel itself has a peculiar odor throughout - especially in the elevators. I would imagine it was because of the intense humidity outdoors but I'm not sure. The elevators are tiny. Rooms are a decent size. Shower has a rain shower head which is not my favourite but that's just personal preference. Breakfast is typical of free Breakfast hotels. Hot and cold options. I would stay here again for the location.Thank you for your excellent review.The humidity is certainly a factor in everything we do, and can be different. It does take some getting used to, but spending time in New Orleans is worth it!!We are a unique property in a unique location and our goal is to by anything but typical!

Had researched this hotel and checked other trip advisor postings and appeared to be a reasonable choice......unfortunately this was not the case. I am a huge fan of Best Westerns in general and have stayed in BWs in Australia, New Zealand and North America, this one by far is inferior. To call it a plus just because it has internet a pool and breakfast is a long shot. Let me give you a brief rundown. The hotel is a 10-15 min cab ride from the airport, there is a shuttle from the airport for 38 pp (all ages) return from your hotel, but a cab for up to 3 passengers was a flat rate of 14 pp one way, there were 3 of us so we cabbed it. Check in was ok, no worries, we had a room on the 2nd floor overlooking the pool....big mistake.....TV wasnt working, reported it to front desk the first day, they forgot, after a sleepless night listening to people come and go at all hours right outside our room and walking back and forwards along the balcony we mentioned it to the front desk and 2 young men were very helpful, one was Lawrentey and the other I cannot remember his name..we mentioned TV not working and no light globe in our bathroom light, but the person who was going to fix it had left so they gave us another room, next door....at least the light worked and the TV.......5 out of 6 nights were noisy noisy noisy, security is apparently on site 10pm-7am but I suspect who ever it was had gone home with the maintenance person as well, never saw them, never heard them....spoke to the front desk and it would appear they may just be one of the many ghosts in the French Quarter. We had 2x double beds and they were hard and air con noisy but at least it worked as it was wonderfully hot during our stay. Bathroom is small, there is a safe and TV is OK. Breakfast is 630-930am, standard BW fare, breakfast meats rotate, that is one day sausage, one day bacon, toast, cereal, bagels, mini muffins, scrambled eggs (powdered) yoghurt, some fruit from a tin and make your own waffles. If you like apple jelly then this is apple jelly heaven.....not much else, it was a rare find indeed to find grape or even strawberry jelly! Juice and coffee is also there as well. Hotel is right at the top end of the French Quarter, close enough to walk to the French quarter, the river front, the french outdoor market and even Harrah's and the outlet shops are only a 20 min walk. Across the road is Louis Armstrong Park, we would go across every morning to feed the ducks, dodge the squirrels and try to avoid the small population of homeless people......still a sad thing to see in 2014! The hop on hop off bus is just a 7 min walk from the hotel, through the park and you can catch it at the info center which is a converted train station and right next door is a cemetery where you can walk around and get a feel for the history, this is where the New Orleans Voodoo Queen Marie Laveau is resting. The hotel has a lounge, sometimes it is open sometimes not.......ice machine on floors 2 and 3, thats it and a crappy vending machine with some coke products in the parking garage. Pool area is nice in the court yard with lots of tables, chairs and lounges. Checkout was a challenge but we got through it, we were honest when she asked how was you stay......didnt appear she wanted to hear what we had to say......here's a tip if you dont want to know the answer dont ask the question!...my advice, you can probably do better....if not try a room away from the pool area.......our 10 year enjoyed the pool and breakfast was ok, internet was ok and overall just an average experience....but New Orleans.....well that a whole other story!","6":"Stayed here late June to early July for 6 nights.

We appreciated the friendly check-in experience as we came from a hotel where front desk staff was rude and made us feel like an interruption. As a BW Gold member, we were also upgraded to a room with a nice view. The Spanish Hacienda architecture is charming and room furnishings were nice. Of course this is an older property and there is some wear and tear. You should consider staying here if you can get a rate 125. The location is perfect. You are right across the street from Mormon Battalion Historic Site and they run an awesome tour I'm not affiliated with LDS and they did not try to proselytize. There are numerous lively mexican restaurants in teh neighborhood and this was the perfect location to stay.Thank you for choosing to stay with us and your loyalty to Best Western.

I think you can't go wrong for the location, but with that being said, the hotel is built on a hill and if you're looking for convenience in parking...be advised....yes, there's parking for an extra 15 and if the lot is full, well, be prepared to do street parking on a very steep hill and do some walking. There is valet parking for more , but after the price of the room, I didn't want to add to my bill. I didn't really mind the street parking b/c I ended up being lucky to be closer to the upper entrance...and, I'm fit and up for a little exercise, but if you're not, be prepared for that! Speaking of hills, being in the very upper part of the hotel there's a lot of outside stairs (that were beautiful in the setting), and there is a elevator, but can be a bit confusing finding your way by walking back down to the lobby. The entire hotel is broken up into different buildings, so I really don't know what the bottom part is like, but the upper blding room seemed nice when first walking in - they did a good job in decor, but to be honest (and why I didn't give it a better rating) it was pretty shabby - bathroom especially and the visual made it feel not so clean (I was one step away from laying down towels to make a pathway) and for 246.21 for a night there, I did expect a little better. I do realize it's in a prime location and that must be the rub! The lobby was very nice and I can't speak to the rooms lower down, but in peanut heaven, I think they need an upgrade! The morning coffee in the lobby wasn't anything special - it's the standard fare - fake creamers no raw sugar packets!It's such a great location...close to Coronado Island and especially to the airport if you have an early flight! It was perfect after a week at family wedding to end up there the day before flying out, was perfect! So, maybe it was very good, but I'm still giving it an average rating for the price!Thank you for your review and recommendations! Please come and see us again. We designed the decor and garden setting to match the vintage California style of Old Town. I am pleased to know there were many areas you found satisfaction in. We hope you will stay again. Please give us a call direct to get the best rates and reservation conditions. We can also work towards fulfilling any personal preferences with regards to room style and location.

On arrival we found that what we had booked was not available. We had booked a king suite for 2 nights and they had us down for 2queen beds for only one night, after some discussion with the front desk a second night was arranged in the same room. Each evening on our return to the hotel we found that our key cards did not work, normally this is not a big deal but this hotel is not like others we have stayed at we're all of the rooms are in the same building. The rooms in this hotel are all in different buildings so a lot of walking is required. Our room was in building 400 facing the rear of a restaurant and each morning we were woke by garbage trucks around 5am. On our last evening there we tried several vending machines to get a bottle of Pepsi but all were out of service , so we went to the fron desk to ask if there was any way to get a bottle and we were told to drive to a store somewhere ourselves to pick it up. The person on the desk was very rude about it. All in all the location was great but the service and the noise outside are room was terribl. On our last morning at breakfast all of the dishes were dirty.We are disheartened to read your review. I'd like to apologize on behalf of our staff for any inconveniences you encountered while with us. It is disappointing that your experience did not reflect our usual high standards and we understand your frustration. It is constructive feedback, such as yours, that really help us get a clear perspective of the areas we need to improve. If another trip calls for a stay in San Diego, please contact me through the hotel. I would like to have our leadership team manage your reservation in a personalized manner. Thank you for taking the time to address these issues and we hope to welcome you back again.","6":"On a recent trip to San Diego we booked online at this hotel.

The room itself was a bit tired but we were expecting this having seen photos. The air con was powerful but noisy. The pool was small but good for a city hotel and never too busy (we used it a fair amount). The hotel is huge though so I feel they were not at full occupancy. Location was excellent- just across the road from the old town. It was also a 10 minute walk from the trolley/ tram system which easily could take you to the centre of town, 5 for a day pass. We arrived at 10am and they were able to give us a room at midday which was nice. We were in block 8 which was just above the carpark. While convenient, most of the other blocks were in much nicer locations, some rooms with views. I dont know if they were different price as Im sure we had the cheapest option. At check in we were given some 20 off vouchers for the hotel restaurant and a free drink voucher which we used once and was quite nice.Thank you for taking the time to sharing your experience with us!Sounds like you had a great summer getaway.

I had visited the city 17 years prior and remembered it being beautiful, but I never made it to Old Town. My one goal for the couple of days we had there was to enjoy some Mexican Food. Well, did we come to the right place or what. The Best Western is situated on the side of the hill with a view of the city and the Pacific. It is like a maze and due to low season there were not a lot of people on the property. It felt like we had the place to ourselves. There is a heated pool and a hot tub which are lovely especially at night. We had two amazing experiences regarding the restaurant Acapulco when we were there. Our first night we arrived after a long day of traveling and we were exhausted and starving. It said in our room book that the restaurant closed at 10pm. I looked at the clock and it was 10:01. I called to ask if there was any chance of getting food. They brought us a HUGE platter of amazing Mexican food and a 6-pack and the total was only 70!!! I was so happy. The next morning for breakfast we went to Acapulco again and were greeted by the very friendly staff. The table next to us had a coupon which they couldn't use for some reason so after they left the waitress applied the coupon to our bill without our knowledge and saved us over 20.00 We were blown away. The room was huge and fit our group of 5 comfortably. The lobby was beautifully decorated for Christmas and they even gave my daughter a lovely Christmas gift from under the tree. It is a one minute walk to the main drag in old town and two minutes to a lovely park up the hill. Also the hotel is very close to the transit system and the State park (which is really cool).Thank you for brining attention to the warm responsive service you received while staying with us. Indeed, Old Town boasts some of the best Mexican fare in all of San Diego. Acapulco is a great choice for any meal we are grateful to have them right on our property.

The service desk staff was friendly enough, but we did have to wait more than an hour for the shuttle to arrive at the airport for the 10-minute drive to the hotel. Being upfront about the delay could have let us call Uber to shorten our 13-hour travel day. The facility was clean enough, but a bit dated in style. There was some language miscommunication with the cleaning staff, but my fault for not running it through the front desk. The property is built on a multi-level terraced hill with multiple steps, patios, and elevators, so double-check your room location if you have concerns about walking any distance. We were about as far from the front desk as possible and had trouble remembering our route the first day. LOLThe free breakfast buffet was a nice surprise, with many options and good service.Thank you for your feedback. I am glad you found the hotels location convenient, your room clean and the staff friendly. Well pass your shuttle comments to the team to take a look at our efficiency levels. Normally, we dont have a problem with timing. Regarding your comment about steps to your room, I want to apologize for any inconvenience this caused. Six of our eight buildings do have elevators but because we are spread out on a hillside, there are also stairs.

Loved the location next to Old Town and the fact once we parked we never had to use our car until check out. A huge plus for my travel party. The shuttle driver was so nice and courteous and punctual. the room was ok as our room view was not what we desired.. I wanted a view of the city/ or bay, instead it was inside the courtyard. But beds and and room was decent. Breakfast was good served at the restaurant, that had a variety of offerings for all. The complaint I have was the Hot Tub, which was luke warm. We were very disappointed at the lack of heat of the spa. That was supposed to be relaxing and refreshing, instead it was like murky coldish bath water. I so wanted to love the hotel for future stays...Greetings, and thank you for your feedback. Im glad to hear that you found our location convenient, room comfortable and shuttle driver friendly.

This front desk lady explained that we needed to wait a little longer for our room but gave us a parking voucher for our car drink coupons. We didn't mind, as it seemed there was plenty to walk around do while waiting. My birthday was the next day on July 4th our reservation was for 3 nights. I was using BWR points that I'd saved for 3 years, as I am also a Best Western employee in another town. Later at check in, a different front desk lady issued our room keys, but had us scheduled for only 1 day, (checking out 7/4/14). After I questioned her, she fixed it in the system, but did not fix my keys, even though I asked her if my keys were ok, she assured me they were. She seemed like a new employee, but said I was good to go. She did not explain that breakfast was NOT included in our stay, nor did she mention a 14 fee for the parking voucher per day. We did know about the 20 per night pet fee. We went to breakfast the next morning, July 4th, and had to pay for it. That's how we found out about the breakfast vouchers. So upon returning to our room later that morning, we were locked out! My husband was upset, so I took the long walk down to the lobby to fix it. The front desk lady was very nice fixed my keys then gave me 2 breakfast vouchers for the next day 2 more drink coupons for our trouble, and cuz it was my birthday. We ended up giving our 6 drink vouchers to a couple in the bar it made their day! Later that afternoon I ran into Douglas Frost, a Front Desk Manager. He liked my puppy Gizmo. I told him it was my birthday explained that I work for Best Western. It was a pleasure talking to him. He was genuinely concerned that we were locked out and not informed of the rules regulations of his hotel upon checking in. He said he would look into it and get back to me. He must have got busy, as I never did hear back from him. However, at check out my parking pet fees were wiped off my credit card. We did use 1 breakfast voucher on Sat another on Sun. My husband doesn't eat breakfast, but we both got to have coffee at the restaurant both days. Nancy cleaned our room that afternoon, minutes after we asked. Thank you for that. A huge Thank you to Hector the bartender for a birthday flan bowl equipped with a lit candle. The Mariachi guys sang Happy Birthday in Spanish English to me. They didn't know my name so they called me Miss America! It was really cute. Upon leaving for the fireworks show at the beach, I slipped on the curb outside the Tequila Facory, cutting my ankle foot in 4 places. The beach was beautiful, however there were no restaurants available, no restrooms available barely anywhere to stand, sit or walk. The fireworks were Spectacular! Found out the next morning that there were over 1/2 million people at the beach for the show It took us 3 hours to get back to our hotel by trolly. Overall, I appreciated the friendly personalities of TRUE Best Western Family Employees. It's easy to see that Best Western cares about their guests, regardless the circumstances. Thank you for a great time.Happy Birthday and thank you for staying with us! Your review is meaningful and we do hope to welcome you (and your pup) back to the hotel again soon.","6":"Check in was 7/3/14, and we arrived early.

Located right in the heart of Old Town San Diego, there are great Mexican restaurants and shopping right outside your door. Unfortunately, the location is the only thing I would rate as Excellent.The rooms were a bit out of date, they could definitely use some updates, especially in the decor-area. The rooms were very, very dark. Not what I would expect in sunny San Diego.I believe my room was especially noisy. I stayed in the 700 building which backs up to the restaurants on the main street. Every morning at 5:30, the garbage truck would back up outside my window and unload the dumpster. Even on Sundays. I also had an adjoining room to a family of four. I could hear every single thing through the door between our rooms, including bathroom noises (not to be too graphic...)We also booked our rooms with the El Presidente package. It entitled us to a free breakfast and free dinner (with two free drinks). The breakfast was decent, especially the days when they had French Toast which was really good. The dinners were okay, with a very limited menu. We chose to eat in town quite a few nights and pass up the free dinners. Strangely, being a part of the El Presidente package also seemed to limit where you were allowed to sit in the restaurant. It would have been nice to eat outside.Overall, I think the hotel is a good value. The location is great and within walking distance of a lot of great sites. I probably would not recommend the hotel if you planned on staying indoors all day!","6":"I recently stayed at the Best Western Hacienda for the week, and I cannot rave enough about the great location of the hotel.

Were sharply competitive with comparable hotels in and around Old Town but as you said, the rates can fluctuate with the seasons and special events. Feel free to give the hotel a call direct to confirm that youre getting the best rates we offer. It also pays to book from our hotels official website. We hope to hear from you. Enjoy your summer travels!

The service, grounds, room, restaurant, bar/lounge, food was all wonderful. Was really nice having a van that dropped off and picked up from airport, train station and ferry terminal. It was great to just walk down the street and you were right in Old Town with all the shops and restaurant.Thank you for highlighting the service, rooms, restaurant and the beauty of our grounds as the reasons you gave us a glowing review. One of the most complimented features of the hotel is the grounds! For those planning a visit, Ill add this descriptions. There are several patio areas with tables and chairs, fountains and blooming bougainvillea and succulents. The hotels walkways are accented with beautiful tiles. The hotel is terraced giving it an even more romantic feeling. We hope your travels bring you back again this year. The holidays are a special time to be in Old Town if you can make it!

I am not a chronic complainer, but this is one of my rare negative reviews.I stayed at the Best Western Hacienda Old Town for 2 nights on November 8th and 9th. My stay started out very positive, but ended on a negative note.First, the positives:Its a great location is the heart of Old Town San Diego. The hotel has a great restaurant on site Old Town Tequila Factory which I rated favorably. Dozens of other restaurants and shops are within a short walk.The Old Town Transit Center is also a few blocks away. There, you can hop on the Trolley to go to Downtown, Qualcomm Stadium and the Mission Valley shopping malls.The negatives:This location charges for parking -- 15 per day (10 for AAA members). This is also one of the few Best Westerns which doesnt offer a free breakfast (AAA members get a 25 discount off their breakfast buffet).My biggest complaint is that I didnt receive any housekeeping service on Monday. When I complained to the Front Desk on Tuesday, they made matters worse.I was traveling on vacation and wanted to sleep later on Monday morning, so I put out my Do Not Disturb sign. I removed the DND sign at 10am Monday when I left for the day. I returned to my room after the football game at 10:30pm to discover that my room was never cleaned.When I mentioned this Tuesday morning, the Front Desk clerk turned the problem around and basically said that it was MY fault that my room wasnt cleaned. I should have called Housekeeping to request service.I have worked in a hotel for 25 years, so I know thats not the way it works. If there is a DND on the door in the morning, Housekeeping returns after lunch to recheck the room. Clearly, this wasnt done.I am not the type of guest who expects a free stay for any minor problem, but I do think it would be appropriate to receive some compensation for my inconvenience of returning to a dirty room.The price I paid for the room includes the cost of providing housekeeping services. If the hotel fails to provide a promised service, they should not charge for it.I have requested that the hotel issue me a refund for the 20 parking fees which would be 10 discount off my total bill. I think that this would be fair and appropriate amount for returning to a dirty room.The Front Desk Manager has admitted that they made a mistake, but the hotel is refusing to issue a refund or any form of compensation for my inconvenience. In light of this poor customer service, I have given the hotel a Poor rating.Thank you for your feedback. As a result of your review, we have revisited our procedures in order to make the changes needed. I apologize for the housekeeping oversight. Please feel free to reach out to me directly if another stay in Old Town is on your agenda so that I can assign a team member to personalize your experience.

Overall the staff were friendly except for when we checked in. We went to the lounge after check in and waited over 15 minutes before being acknowledged (while sitting at the bar), and then another 10 minutes before we received a drink. I really wanted to eat there as the food looked amazing last year, but we chose to dine somewhere else. Our hotel room was beside a meeting room that was booked both mornings of our stay so we were woken up at 6:45am both days. Their food beverages were set up outside our window so it was loud and we were not able to sleep in. The hotel itself is beautiful and the hot tub pool area is a lot of fun. The rooms are a bit difficult to locate as there are multiple buildings and levels.","6":"We came back after a bad experience last year as the manager offered us a discount to try it out again.

Appreciated that they had a shuttle to pick us up within 20 mins from the airport. Using AAA card gave us a free buffet breakfast which was quite good. We first came on a Weds which was a an evening they had free Mexican food and a drink in the lobby which was good enough for our dinner that night. The room was fine and the beds were comfortable. The staff were all pleasant and even the housekeepers like Carmen, gave us warm greetings each day. The views over the city especially at sunset were enjoyable and the patios had pretty plants. Too chilly in Feb to try the pool but it looked nice. We were in the 300 building the first time and the 600 one the 2nd time. The 600 one takes a bit of effort to wind your way to it through 3 or 4 elevators but the rooms were fine. The Tequila restaurant was good for drinks and a snack and also for meals. Only a matter of a minute to walk to the town or to get the hop on hop off bus. A 5 minute walk takes you to the tram where you can then get a bus to the zoo. Not hard to figure out and the locals were also helpful. Greetings, and thank you for your recent stay. Its always a delight to hear about our guests experience. Your description is filled with great tips which will surely be helpful to those planning a visit. Carmen is an asset to our housekeeping team and will receive recognition! We hope your future plans will include a return visit. Please feel free to reach out to me if I can offer any assistance. Until then - we wish you safe travels!

I booked a room with a two queens and a sofa sleeper for our family of five but when we got to our room in Building 4 there was no sofa sleeper. We headed back down to the lobby and the front desk clerk asked, Are you sure We had to laugh at that. Another staff member offered to show us two other room choices. She walked us around to the rooms and was very courteous and professional. Our luggage was moved from the old room to the new room in Building 6 quickly and efficiently. The parking area for Building 6 is very small and fills up early in the evening. The parking spaces themselves are impossibly narrow and hard to get out of. The local channels on our TV were awfully static and hard to watch while the cable stations came in clear. But in spite of all that, our room was clean, comfortable and spacious enough for our family. Old Town is a great area to stay in with lots of restaurants, museums and things to explore. Plus it is centrally located...less than 10 - 15 minutes to Downtown, Balboa Park, La Jolla Cove and the Airport. Good stay, great location!Thank you for your recent stay with us and for taking the time to tell us what you thought! I apologize the room didnt have the sofa sleeper as expected, but Im very happy to hear one of our staff members went the extra mile to remedy the situation and get you into a room suited nicely for your family! Please come see us again the next time you are in the area, and until then-- happy travels!","6":"Located on a hillside overlooking Old Town San Diego, the Best Western Plus Hacienda has charm but has a rather quirky layout.

But , considering the location to the airport, Amtrak Location, and Old Town ( a very nice array of restaurants,bars and gift shops in a revitalized set of buildings dating back to the late 1880's. You can walk and see a great deal. Legoland is about 45 minutes north of the hotel in Carlsbad. And, about 20 minutes from the San Diego Zoo. Both attractions are family related . You will spend the entire day at each location. Back at the hotel, you will find a parking fee of 10.00 a night. The restaurant located just at the back of the facility has a nice bar,with lots of t.v.s playing sporting events and a restaurant that offers a nice meal at a 10- 20 range . Here's the deal though ! If you are a AAA Automobile member, you can't get a better deal ,period! If you use your AAA card you pay up 20 off per night, 50 off the parking per night and 2 free buffet breakfasts each day of your stay. Use the card and you will return home filled with happy thoughts knowing you had a great time and won't have a huge credit card bill the following month.Thank you for your loyalty!

The location is great for walking around the Old Town area, and conveniently located to drive most places in San Diego. I think this place has a bit of arrogance in the way their run their business, though. When we arrived to move into our room with bay views, we got shoveled in a dirty, smelly room in the far upper corners of a building facing a park. I called the office and asked why we were paying for a bay view and got this room. We had to haul our luggage back down to the parkade and drive all the way back to the office to talk to them. They seemed quite upset that we were questioning the room we got they tried again with a room directly across from the stairwell facing a wall, but we refused that room as well. Their third try was this is the last room we have, which we took. It did face the bay, but was a corner room with the stairwell right in front of the door, which made it a little noisy when people's children were running up and down the stairs and breezeways. It was quite a big larger than the first room they tried to put us in, though. When I asked why we didn't get the room we had booked months in advance, the response was we're full. Huh Stay was OK because we didn't have to engage with the staff again until we checked out. Lots of steps and climbs up and down the road if you're in the upper buildings. Restaurant staff on the arrogant side as well. Must be catchy at this hotel! Parking is horrible - don't bring anything bigger than a Ford Fiesta! Wouldn't stay here again. Sadly, they have a great location, but really indifferent, slightly arrogant, almost rude staff. I'd head for Coronado next time!","6":"Stayed here in the Spring of 2012.

Well maintained and nicely landscaped property. The property is on a hill overlooking the Main Street of old Town San Diego with more Mexican restaurants than you ever thought possible.

The room was just beautiful, as nice as a 5 star hotel I had previously stayed in. They offer a free breakfast with juic3, coffee, eggs, bacon, waffles, donuts, toast, danish and more. I couldn't believe how much when I walked in. The room was a bit small but people were nice with making room. This hotel is so close to Old Town and Sea World you never need to get back on the freeway unless you chooose to. I went up to Mission Bay and followed that into Old Town. Rooms are a great size also and lots of parking available. Its a fantastic hotel to choose and I will stay here on my next San Diego visit. The staff was the friendliest people I have ever met. The man who checked me in made sure I was happy and under stood everything. Pool has a code and he explainex that and it opened very easily. Nice pool abd nice spa. I liked that when I checked in the gentleman wrote the pool code and breakfast hours on the paper that held the room key. Very very professional and friendly. I didnt want to go home. Great Hotel.

We had three rooms with exterior access on the third floor. The second night there we realized why we were so warm was that our window was ajar by about 6 inches. So we closed and locked the window, and called the front office to inquire why it was opened. The front office said housekeeping must have opened it. I had my family close their windows also.Imagine our dismay the next day, when we stopped back to our rooms around 5pm, and all our windows were once again open. It would have been an easy matter for anyone to take a knife and slit the screen, slide the window fully open, and climb into our rooms. One of our rooms was occupied by a 23 yr old young woman. We once again relocked our windows. I can only guess that housekeeping was instructed to turn off the air conditioning, it was mid-70's, and open the window when they cleaned the rooms. I noticed other rooms on the 2nd floor were also left the same way.When I checked out I told Bill the manager that compromising the safety of guests was not acceptable. And, my guess is that housekeeping was told to open all the windows as part of the daily routine. I was not pleased he blamed housekeeping. I promised to inform Best Western at corporate headquarters and write a review, and I did both. Corporate was very supportive and shared my concern in regards to hotel safely. I have no doubt they took the appropriate action and future guests are now safe. But, check your windows when you return each night!Your business is very important to us and we value your feedback.

It is across the freeway from mission bay park where there are places to play and relax. The hotel room was very clean but in serious need of an update. This is a reasonably priced hotel for the area. Parking is free and there is a great selection for the included breakfast.

We had planned 5 days in San Diego.. We looked at hotels and motels by the beach. We quickly decided staying on the beach was super super pricey. This Best western worked out great. Although it is not on the beach, it is an easy 6 min drive from the beach. 6 min drive to old town San Diego as well. The breakfast had a great variety! I am gluten free and generally have limited options. This breakfast offered eggs, bacon, fruit and yogurt. They also offered a variety of other items as well waffles and breakfast burritos and breakfast sandwiches. It can be a bit of a noisy place( to no fault to the hotel) Kids can be a bit rowdy lol The pool was so fantastic! We enjoyed it almost everyday. The room was clean and spacious as well.

The bathroom was the right size and we had planty of room for relaxing and dining. I have 2 small children and they were very comfortable. To keep them busy, I hooked up my media streamer to the LCD tv and away the kids went with their cartoons. The pool was a nice plus. While not too large, it was plenty for the people that partook. The kids made many friends while at the pool and we had several kids come to our room to invite my kids to come down to the pool. I can't say enough about the breakfast. The days we were at the hotel, the breakfast was amazing. Eggs, bacon, muffins, cereal, jucies, waffles, etc...just about everything that my kids love for breakfast. Different days had different breakfast specials. One day was breakfast sandwiches which were quite good. Another day was breakfast burritos which were also quite good, but there was no salsa.

That area is also very, very busy with lots of traffic. The Best Western Mission Bay was literally right over the bridge from Mission Bay which made getting to the water very easy. However, I was disappointed that there are no ocean views from any of the rooms. Being this close to the water, I thought there would be.My room was comfortable, though there were some snags. First, the red light on my phone kept flashing the entire length of my stay, even though I told the front desk about it immediately upon my check in. It was a three week old message to someone who had stayed in that room previously.Also, the ice machine did not work on my floor, and I had to go to another floor every time I needed ice. Again, I informed the front desk about the non-functioning ice machine within an hour of my arrival and they just told me to use one on another floor. (I was on the top floor, and the elevator was s---l---o---w.) The ice machine still was not fixed by the end of my stay.The third annoyance was that there was no remote for the television when I checked in. However, they did send someone to my room with a remote within 20 minutes of my calling the front desk.On a positive note, the bed was very comfortable, and the staff friendly. The best thing was the complimentary breakfast every morning. It had something for everyone and was very good. This really is a welcome amenity for me, since I don't like having to search out and drive to a restaurant first thing in the morning to have breakfast.The Best Western Mission Bay is a comfortable, no frills, convenient place to stay if you are just looking for a place to sleep and change clothes. Overall it seemed clean and safe. A few steps up from a Motel 6, but not a fancy resort either. A good compromise for the price.Good Afternoon,We would like to thank you for staying with us and posting a review for Tripadvisor.Thank you so much for your compliments to our property.

The rooms need an uplift. The free breakfast has limited options and the breakfast room is really small. Better to take the food to your room if its on a lower level. There is 1 elevator in the entire hotel and it quite a walk from the elevators to the rooms in the opposite wings. There is limited parking available near the elevators, but there is lot of parking otherwise on the property.Thank you for your review.

After staying one night, I have to disagree. I suppose if you are staying and you have a car, it probably is a good location because it's really close to the highway- but we only stayed one night, so we didn't have a car, and the location was terrible. There was nothing to do near the hotel, I am not from the area, so it was hard for me to tell if this is a 'good area' or not, but I was not about to walk around alone. Our hotel room was clean and comfortable, but we only had one working outlet in the room. All of the other outlets were a major fire hazard as they only allowed the plugs to go in half-way. Breakfast was fine, but crowded and I couldn't get the wifi to work. As we were checking out, we watched a mouse swimming around in the pool. With all the being said- every single hotel employee that I spoke with was extremely kind and helpful. They are definitely doing customer service the right way!","6":"I booked this hotel based on the great reviews it got, and that people seemed to feel like it was in a 'great location'.

It smelled like someone tried to cover a moldy smell with air freshener that smelled like cologne. Though the bed was comfortable, the sheets were dirty on one of the beds, as if someone had walked across it with shoes on. The room had a mini fridge but it was turned down to 1 so I had to turn it on to store my food items. I was given room 115, which unfortunately for me was right near the breakfast area so as soon as breakfast was available I was woken up by everyone walking by and holding loud conversations. Then at 7:45am, what I can only assume was a dance troop staying there, started practicing their routines in the middle of the parking lot while blasting their music and yelling. At 9am when I went to check out they were still going strong and oblivious to anyone trying to navigate the lot. When I was trying to back up, one of them walked up behind my vehicle and I had to ask them to move. Then after pulling out of my spot and attempting to leave, a few of them almost walked right in front of me because they were not paying attention. I find it extremely RUDE that they assumed everyone would be wide awake and want to listen to this. I also find it RUDE that the hotel manager did not go out there and ask them to stop because it may be disturbing other guests. On behalf of our entire team, I would like to apologize for not exceeding your expectations. Your satisfaction is important to us and we will be using the feedback you gave us to implement improvements to ensure we offer a better experience for guests in the future.","6":"Room needed some work, or a deep cleaning.

This hotel however was the biggest disappointment of our trip. We had booked the Hilton, but then found this at half the cost decided to book it so we could spend our money on other things. We wished we'd stuck with the Hilton. I'm not normally one for writing a bad review (in fact it's my 1st I feel like I'm being mean!) it wasn't really that bad, it just wasn't the best one on our trip. We'd booked a cheaper one in Morro Bay, (we wanted to experience a Motel) which knocked the socks of this hotel for both room service!Before we arrived we had emailed the hotel to let them know we had just got married, to ask if they had any upgrades. They kindly offered us 2 options: a free upgrade to a garden view or a paid one into a front facing harbour view. We said yes to the paid one, as it was our honeymoon after all. When we arrived at the hotel, the guy on reception had no details about it at all. When we asked about it he said we would have to speak to the manager in the morning and see if there were any free the next day. We were disappointed to say the least, especially as we had the email with the confirmation. We didn't bother speaking to the manager the next day, we were only there for 2 nights didn't want to spend the time moaning:) So we just took the room they had. It was ok. We found out it was the garden view (overlooking 3 palm trees:)). It was clean did the job. Breakfast was not great. Greasy food most of it looked unhygienic. So I didn't bother. My husband ate the bagels. Before we went out for the day I asked reception about a group of seals we had heard about by the harbour where we were likely to find them. He basically laughed at me and said 'you'll just hear them, they are everywhere'. Thought it was a bit rude. As it turns out we saw hundreds all the way up highway 1, quite an experience for us coming from the UK. If you just want a cheaper option for a pit stop, it will do the job. It was clean after all. If you want somewhere nicer, book the Hilton.","6":"We had an amazing road trip, after getting married in Las Vegas, ending in San Francisco.

What drew me in was the location, proximity to airport as well as the free parking, which is a money saver. We were a little disappointed in the neighborhood there were not a lot of food options nearby, but when it was time for us to head to the airport we were 5 minutes away. The parking was free, which is great, but there is no elevator from either level of the parking. We had very large suitcases and it was just myself and my small children so it was a bit of a struggle. The lobby is small, but clean. The staff were friendly and professional. The pool is located in front of the hotel, on the main road and is quite small. There was a laundry room on our floor, but did not use it. Our room was fine, clean and neat. The hotel itself is a little old and it is showing its age, but not necessarily in a bad way. Negatives are the beds were extremely hard and uncomfortable, at least for us. Also, we were placed on the second floor, but it seemed to be more the first floor. The parking was directly outside our room and cars were parked immediately in front of our patio, so close we could have reached out and touched them. I wasn't a fan of this as people came back to the hotel at 3 am, parked immediately in front of our room and were having trouble locking their car door so the car kept beeping it's horn. Also, starting at 6 am there are jet planes flying over. It wasn't bothersome to us, kids slept right through it. We would stay here again, just request a higher floor, maybe not facing the parking area.","6":"We got a great deal on this hotel through Expedia.

King bed was bottomed out on one side..the other side was fine so I just slept on the one good side. No hot water 2nd day for about 2 hours--right after I got back from the gym needed that shower so that put my drive to L.A. back 2 hours. (hair dryer didn't work). There was a leaky ceiling in the lobby dripping into a floor basket--and what ever caused that problem seemed to affect my room water service. When the hot water went down the toilet stopped flushing properly--that lasted 2 days before being fixed. The breakfast here was poor. Each morning there was a basket of black bananas there were the usual sweets (muffins and frosted sugary treats). There was some kind of weird egg that was folded to look like a mini omelette--stuffed with orange cheese. It was kind of rubbery and tasted weird. The potatoes were dry and kind of like tator tots. I just stayed with coffee and juice after the 1st day. There was a front desk person that kept referring to me as boss...no problem boss you got it boss, etc. I thought that was unprofessional and a demeaning term. You may use the term boss on a construction site or road crew, but not in a professional environment. When I checked out the lady at registration didn't even ask how my stay was..or wish me a good trip as I left..I felt she could care less. You have MANY options during your stay in San Diego. So consider your plans before booking here. By the way this hotel is located on a very busy street. Lots of traffic noise as Harbor Drive is a main road traveled coming out of the airport. This whole area is heavily impacted by traffic.","6":"Here's the short version of my 5 nights at this hotel.

No hot water 2nd day for about 2 hours--right after I got back from the gym needed that shower so that put my drive to L.A. back 2 hours. (hair dryer didn't work). There was a leaky ceiling in the lobby dripping into a floor basket--and what ever caused that problem seemed to affect my room water service. When the hot water went down the toilet stopped flushing properly--that lasted 2 days before being fixed. The breakfast here was poor. Each morning there was a basket of black bananas there were the usual sweets (muffins and frosted sugary treats). There was some kind of weird egg that was folded to look like a mini omelette--stuffed with orange cheese. It was kind of rubbery and tasted weird. The potatoes were dry and kind of like tator tots. I just stayed with coffee and juice after the 1st day. There was a front desk person that kept referring to me as boss... no problem boss you got it boss, etc. I thought that was unprofessional and a demeaning term. You may use the term boss on a construction site or road crew, but not in a professional environment. When I checked out the lady at registration didn't even ask how my stay was.. or wish me a good trip as I left.. I felt she could care less. You have MANY options during your stay in San Diego. So consider your plans before booking here. By the way this hotel is located on a very busy street. Lots of traffic noise as Harbor Drive is a main road traveled coming out of the airport. This whole area is heavily impacted by traffic.","7":["front desk person","room water service","hot water 2nd","one good side","one side","good trip","other side","short version","King bed","L.A.","hair dryer","leaky ceiling","black bananas","usual sweets","sugary treats","weird egg","mini omelette","orange cheese","tator tots","1st day","demeaning term","construction site","road crew","professional environment","MANY options","San Diego","busy street","main road","floor basket","term boss","traffic noise","Harbor Drive","problem boss","5 nights","hotel","2 hours","gym","shower","lobby","toilet","breakfast","muffins","kind","potatoes","coffee","juice","unprofessional","lady","registration","stay","plans","way","Lots","airport","area"],"8":"mixed"},{"0":"Rancho Santa Margarita","1":"32.7262","2":"-117.2254","3":"Best Western Yacht Harbor Hotel","4":"5","5":"Every aspect of our stay was excellent!

And since the hotel is fronted by a busy 4 lane highway. The road noise on our small balcony, was so loud, you had to shout over the loud road noise, making it useless.

Since there really isn't much of a view of the harbour, we gave up on a veiw rm and moved to a 3rd floor quite parking lot side room. But the rugs here had been shampoo and were soaken wet.

We arrived early at the airport but there was no problem catching a shuttle to the hotel. The hotel representative gave us great directions to reach the pick-up point. When we arrived at the hotel, we were able to check-in early always a great treat. All front desk staff were courteous, friendly and helpful throughout our stay. Also, housekeeping provided great service too.The hotel sits in an excellent location just opposite the harbor. We were able to walk over to watch the fishing charters going in and out as well as sailing regattas on the weekend. There are also several restaurants in that area. We particularly enjoyed Mitchs Seafood.Our room was spacious and spotless. It had a small microwave as well as an oversized mini-frig. There was a desk area and, of course, free wifi was included. Each room has a balcony which is perfect in the cool evenings. From the hotel its a quick walk to a nearby Ralphs grocery where we purchased a few snacks/beverages. The ice machines always had plenty of ice.Our room rate included a great hot breakfast buffet which varied daily. There were always scrambled eggs, toast, bagels, muffins, cereal, yogurt, fruit and a pancake machine. The hot items varied each morning: diced potatoes plus biscuits gravy then sausage plus tater tots then bacon plus tater tots. The staff members did a great job of keeping items replenished as well as wiping down tables. The breakfast area is a bit small but an overflow room was set-up next door until renovation of the area can be completed.Speaking of renovations, we were amazed each morning as to the progress being made on re-doing the first floor flooring. The new flooring looks terrific! Also the lobby area is lovely and there is coffee/tea available there 24 hrs. Theres a nice sitting area by the pool/hot tub as well as a couple of tables outside the pool area.We definitely enjoyed our stay and recommend this property to others.

We had a beautiful view of the harbor but I was a little bit bummed I couldn't see downtown due to a stairwell blocking that view. We were on the fifth floor though and had a view of the pool which was helpful when our 15 year old son went swimming and I was able to call down to him when I had a question for him. Our son came with us at the last minute so we had to add on a rollaway bed and that caused no problem at all. We left the hotel, shortly after checking in and when we returned, the bed was there. The room and rest of the hotel was clean and inviting. The staff were friendly and helpful. The room was hot when we first arrived but the air conditioner worked perfect and cooled it down in little time. Our son used the pool and swam alone (for the first time in his life) for the entire time he was there. The pool temp and condition was perfect and he said it was nice and he really liked it. Even though the hotel was sold out, we never felt like it was crowded and never heard our neighbors. We also found parking in the covered lot on both nights we arrived back late. The breakfast was just ok. It is a continental breakfast though so in that vein, it was normal. However, it was very clean in the room and pleasantly decorated and arranged. They had a separate dining area for overflow or if you didn't want to be in the room with the food prep and television. The staff were friendly and helpful. Overall, we had a wonderful stay here and I'd definitely return to the same location to stay overnight again. The highlight was walking out onto our balcony, on the last morning we were there (on a Sunday), to the view of the harbor with The Star Spangled Banner playing on speakers nearby, just loud enough for me to get misty-eyed. Beautiful moment.","6":"I got the room, view and bed I requested for my family of three.

After feigning hearing issues with her behind glass, I asked to be let in the lobby and was let in and saw security camera monitors were pointed at every possible corner of the grounds. We got a room on the 3rd floor and the automatic door facing the hall to the rooms was broken. We had to walk all the way around the outside. We get to the elevator and its down for maintenance. I went back into the lobby and asked for a first floor room or second floor at least and she gave us one. When we got in the room though we were pleasantly surprised. The room looked updated for the most part with a nice granite counter outside the bathroom, counter height refrigerator and microwave. Horrible outdated tv though and ours had a loud screeching sound until it got warmed up. Bathroom was unbearably small. You had to step in and go behind the toilet to close the door. Outlets were lacking too. My husband and I both use our cell phones as alarms and want to plug in our phones next to the bed but there were not outlets anywhere near it. I had to unplug a lamp on the other side of the room. Beds and pillows were comfortable. Breakfast was blah but I wasn't expecting much from continental. Lo and behold, something else was broken! There are two Belgian waffle makers and one was out of order so we waited a very long time for our turn. Cereal, pastries, toast, coffee, etc. Every piece of fruit I got was a little past prime. Nothing to rave about.Overall, for the money, great deal and adequate for short hotel stay.","6":"First, some things that us question our choice: We arrived for a long stay around 10pm on a Friday and the lobby main door was locked... we had to use a bullet proof night window to check in (like a bank would have in a not so nice part of town).

Will never make that mistake again. Pulled into hotel lot on a Saturday night about 10:00 p.m. Lot was COMPLETELY full even at that fairly early hour, lot spaces are very inadequate to the number of rooms. Finally managed to find a place after circling four times. Just as I was only pulling my bags out, three cars in the lot, all vehicles carrying gangbanger types drove by (looking to park at the hotel, not leaving), looking at me and scoping out my car. Similar type patrons in the lobby and around the exterior corridors of the hotel. I am not shy about travel, I have walked and worked in rough downtown areas, but I do expect to feel at least a modicum of safety for my person and belongings/vehicle. As I was walking to the lobby, two police cruisers came into the lot, one to circle, the other to park for awhile. At that point, I had it -- I informed the management that I would rather waste my priceline bid and go stay somewhere else, which I did. I am very disappointed that a Best Western would allow this activity on its property. The police did not seem to act like this was an isolated incident, but rather one of their regular patrols. I do not leave a negative review unless I feel it really warrants it, and this one wins first prize for me. I will never book this property again, let alone stay here. It is unsafe-feeling, and I would never take a family here.On behalf of myself and the entire staff here at the Best Western Inn Miramar, we are saddened to hear that a guest was displeased with his recent experience at the hotel. We pride ourselves on excellent guest service, beautiful and comfortable accommodations, and a safe and pleasant experience. The location of this hotel is in close proximity to the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar and is a very safe location. One of our most respected accounts is one that is with a Marine Division on this base. During the evening this guest checked in with us we had a large group of this Marine Division staying with us. We feel privileged to have the Marine Division stay at the Best Western Inn Miramar. They are the very men and women who protect our country and we are honored to have them at the hotel. They are often times not in military uniform during their stay at the hotel but are by no means gangbangers. They are polite, quiet, and very respectable guests. We have a very close relationship with their command and have never had any problems with them in the many years they have used us as their preferred hotel. To ensure the safety of all of our guests we have area officers occasionally do courtesy visits to the hotel as they do other hotels in the surrounding area. The Best Western Inn Miramar is in a very safe area and is located in a county with a dedicated and very courteous police force. There was no activity going on at the hotel and we thank the police for being kind enough to check up on us once in awhile, stop in for a cup of coffee and say hello. We appreciate their service.We are sorry that the guests experienced anything but absolute satisfaction during his visit as it is our goal to provide nothing but the best for each and every one of our guests whether they are business men, military soldiers, sports teams, or family vacationers.

We were 20 minutes to Sea World and downtown. Friends who stayed downtown had to pay 50 per night for parking. We never had a chance to use the courtyard pool but we appreciated the pastry, egg, sausage, cereal, and waffle breakfast options. Perfect for us that they start serving at 6am. Room was clean and everything was in working order. Beds were a bit on the firm side. WiFi didn't work with the password we were given. Our main goal was a safe clean place in San Diego with breakfast within a budget and this Best Western checked those boxes. It is no longer a Best Western Plus. You can see the old sign on the ground in the parking lot. I forgot to ask front desk about the change. The breakfast included with the price of the room still makes them better than other Best Western hotels in the area but there must be other requirements to keep the Plus title. Dear mrsp-alisoviejoThank you for taking the time to review the hotel. We greatly appreciate your feedback. Thank you for mentioning that we are only 20-25 minutes away from most our attractions here in San Diego. One of the benefits of staying up in Miramar is that you get better pricing since we are not next to our attractions. When you stay at the Best Western you also do not have to worry about a daily parking fee, like you do in the downtown locations. Parking here is free. I am glad that we were able to check of all the boxes our your needs.Thank you for staying with us.","6":"This was a convenient and fairly priced place to stay in San Diego.

We never had a chance to use the courtyard pool but we appreciated the pastry, egg, sausage, cereal, and waffle breakfast options. Perfect for us that they start serving at 6am. Room was clean and everything was in working order. Beds were a bit on the firm side. WiFi didn't work with the password we were given. Our main goal was a safe clean place in San Diego with breakfast within a budget and this Best Western checked those boxes. It is no longer a Best Western Plus. You can see the old sign on the ground in the parking lot. I forgot to ask front desk about the change. The breakfast included with the price of the room still makes them better than other Best Western hotels in the area but there must be other requirements to keep the Plus title. Dear mrsp-alisoviejoThank you for taking the time to review the hotel. We greatly appreciate your feedback. Thank you for mentioning that we are only 20-25 minutes away from most our attractions here in San Diego. One of the benefits of staying up in Miramar is that you get better pricing since we are not next to our attractions. When you stay at the Best Western you also do not have to worry about a daily parking fee, like you do in the downtown locations. Parking here is free. I am glad that we were able to check of all the boxes our your needs.

We would like to thanks the Asian lady who worked at the front desk and assisted us when we check-in to the hotel late at night. She was very patient with us and went out of her way to help us find the most suitable and comfortable room for our staying. We have to request room change for three times. The first room assigned was not clean, and the second one we moved to turned out to be the smoking room, but we requested a non-smoking room since we were traveling with two young kids. The lady (sorry that we forgot her name) was very patient with us and have the most positive attitude when helping us finding the most satisfy room for our staying. She also gave us good recommendations on where to find a quick dinning place near the hotel, since it's late at night and we were tired from a long drive. We would like to take this chance to thanks her so much for all her help. The price for the hotel staying was reasonable and it included breakfast. Breakfast area was not big, but had enough space to move around. Breakfast was served from 6am -9am, and as long as you go there early in the morning, before the rush hours (8-9am), you wont have problem to find seating and enjoy your breakfast. Breakfasts are the usual choices, but they will fill you up. It was a good starter in the morning before we headed out to the theme parks. We didn't have the chance to use the in-room microwave, but the refrigerator came in handy. TV was a good size had had enough channels for us to watch. The bed and pillows were comfortable, so we had no problem fall in sleep at night. The only thing we questioned was the in-room safe box. It required a credit card to operate, so we wondered if the hotel would charge us for using it. The neighborhood seemed pretty quiet and safe, even though its close to the freeway, no noise was heard at night, and no weird people hanged around the hotel property. There were plenty of parking spaces around, and we had no problem finding parking space when we returned to the hotel late at night. The pool area looked pretty clean, but we didnt get to use it since our staying was during the cold winter days, we might have enjoy the pool more if we stay during summer time. Overall the hotel staying is a good experience for us. We will recommend this hotel and will likely to stay again if we are returning to the area.Dear Alice C, Thank you for taking the time in reviewing the Best Western Plus San Diego/Miramar.

And they don't tell you that until you are checking out, it just shows up on your bill. The check-in clerk the first night was quirky and nice but the other staff throughout our four night stay were not very unfriendly. Housekeeping started knocking on doors to clean the rooms at 7:30 each morning. We were getting ready to leave about 8:30 one morning, loading stuff for our day trip. The maid asked me if I wanted them to skip cleaning our room for the day, since we were next in line and we weren't gone yet. The hot food served for breakfast was marginal.

Let me start by thanking you for completing our Guest Survey regarding your recent stay at our property. I apologize for not exceeding your expectations. We strive to ensure each and every guest experience is satisfying. Please know that we are taking your feedback to heart and focusing on improving. As you know when you buy your room through hotwire / priceline with name your price you are giving up lot of prevallage, such as choice of your hotel, room type ect. This type of booking channel will give you deep discount but any guest request is subject to availabity, if we don't have same room type we offer guest choice to upgrade to diffrent room type and pay the diffrence (once again this upgrade is subject to availability). I advice if guest has specific need please book through Bestwestern.com and select room type of their need. Each room type and rates are clearly explain. Again, I apologize for the inconvenience during your stay and hope to see you during your next visit.","7":["unsuspecting customers extra money","customer service agents","front desk clerk","same room type","diffrent room type","extra revenue","smoking room","booking channel","deep discount","next visit","Guest Survey","guest experience","guest request","recent stay","specific need","guest choice","Priceline.com","reservation","hotel","Calls","effect","people","Hotwire","scam","property","expectations","feedback","heart","name","lot","prevallage","availabity","diffrence","upgrade","availability","Bestwestern","rates","inconvenience"],"8":"mixed"},{"0":"Arroyo Grande","1":"32.8923","2":"-117.1188","3":"Best Western San Diego/Miramar Hotel","4":"4","5":"I believe that the Best Western has a great product at a reasonable rate. the only area that they could improve on is there staffing.

The hotel is within a reasonable distance from the site of Alliant U campus. The hotel was clean, the beds were extremely comfortable, and the towels were the best (softest and dried better) than any other we have had this year. Almost like home. The internet connected easily, but the desk provided in our room was small and the only light hung above in the ceiling. The chair provided was not an office type chair, unable to adjust the height. This made internet use a bit more difficult. Breakfast was normal for a Best Western. We chose to go to the IHop just across the street instead for more variety. And that was an experience in itself - a positive one. Overall it was a great price for San Diego. The room was more than adequate for our purposes. And our room was quiet and dark enough. Hate the taxes in San Diego for visitors. Seems to be a growing trend, soak the tourists.Dear Joel,Thank you for investing the time to review your stay with us.

Unfortunately, the room that i ended up with had many problems. All 3 rooms were non-smoking room, but right when i walked into the room, you can smell the aroma of cigarettes. The second problem faced was the dysfunctional microwave in the room. We called the front desk to come fix it for us, they were nice enough to come see what was wrong with it and come fix it however, i don't know what they fixed because the microwave did not heat up the food at all. The third, but biggest, problem was the BED BUGS! Even though they might say their hotel is bug free, we faced these little pests late at night. My son was bitten many times(pictures included) and I was bit once on my eyebrow on the last night. Luckily, we caught one bug that was still moving around in the morning and showed them to the front desk. We asked for a discount because all the nights we stayed there were met with discomfort however the best they did for us was a discount for one night. We called the manager and explained our situations after our stay and he wasn't much of a help either.Thank you for expressing your concerns in regards to your recent experience at the Best Western Miramar. The concerns you have raised are very understandable given what you described, and I appreciate the opportunity to look into it and respond.The global resurgence of bed bugs over the last five years is a widely-recognized problem. It is suspected that this resurgence is a direct result of increased international travel to and from the United States, since bed bugs are easily transported in suitcases, clothing, and purses among other things. To address this growing problems, we have a continuous pest control policy in place at our property and have implemented a thorough training program for our housekeeping and maintenance personnel to assist in the early recognition of infestation.Our certified pest control vendor has visited the property and assures us that there is no current infestation on property. Given the nature of our business, it is our expressed commitment to make sure every guest experience an enjoyable one.
